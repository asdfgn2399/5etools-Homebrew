            "In 1979, as a precocious ten-year-old with a yen for puzzles, I was always excited to get my hands on a copy of Games magazine. The September/October 1979 issue, though, seized my attention like no other had, because it included a feature article that described an entirely new kind of game—one involving maps, monsters, and hunting for treasure—called “Dungeons & Dragons.” I showed the article to my mother, and before long, I had the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set in my hands. It contained a rulebook, an adventure module called “The Keep on the Borderlands,” and a set of the exact same hard polymer polyhedral dice I’d seen advertised in my mom’s teacher supply catalogs.",
            "We sat down to play it, and… neither of us could figure out what to do.",
            "It sat on my shelf for a long time.",
            "Later, in high school, I got together with a group of friends who had figured it out and were playing D&D along with other roleplaying games such as Villains & Vigilantes and Call of Cthulhu. Four of us formed a tight group that played D&D, taking turns as Dungeon Master, starting with my friend Julian. I was last in the rotation, so I got to see three different examples of how to be a DM before taking on the job myself.",
            "In those years, I didn’t think of what we were doing in our D&D games in strategic or tactical terms. None of us did. We had plan A (“Get ’em!”) and plan B (“Run!”), and that was the extent of it.",
            "That group disbanded when, one by one, we stopped coming home from college over the summer. I kept playing D&D for a year or two after that in college, but I’d begun to lose interest in the high-fantasy roleplaying genre; then early adulthood hit, and multiple intercity moves in pursuit of work, and I never managed to find another gaming group that I clicked with. Eventually, I returned home to Chicago and reconnected with Julian and some other players—but by that time, they’d moved on from D&D as well. They were playing GURPS (the Generic Universal Role-Playing System), which worked with any genre, including fantasy.",
            "Everything changed in 2015, when my wife came home from work one day and asked me whether I could help get a D&D game going with some of her coworkers. (Someone at her office had referred to a client as “someone who looks like he’d play Dungeons & Dragons in his mother’s basement,” to which one of the aforementioned coworkers had replied, deadpan, “I would totally play Dungeons & Dragons.”) My first thought was to run a fantasy campaign using GURPS, but my wife said her coworkers wanted to play D&D, and she prevailed on me to stick with the biggest name in roleplaying games.",
            "I hadn’t played D&D since shortly after the second edition of the game came out, and I hadn’t kept any of my books, so I went to a friendly local game store and bought the D&D Starter Set. The timing couldn’t have been better: Wizards of the Coast, which had bought the rights to D&D from its original publisher, TSR Inc., had recently released the fifth edition of the game. This edition had taken a hulking gallimaufry of accumulated rules and options and streamlined it into a tight, consistent system that treated all its core functions—attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks—the same way, reducing a plethora of lookup tables to simple calculations, while preserving the game’s high-fantasy soul. The more I got into it, the more I liked it (even though I still favored anchored fantasy over wild, fantastic, superheroic fantasy). I also began to recognize certain emergent properties of some of fifth edition D&D’s mechanics—properties with tactical implications.",
            "As a young person, I’d always been interested in strategy games, but I’d also never been particularly good at them, because I never learned to think strategically. What really drove this fact home for me, a couple of years before discovering fifth edition D&D, was playing the computer game XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Over and over, I kept getting massacred, even on the easiest levels. What was I doing wrong? I had no idea. However, by that time, after many hard years, I had finally learned how to learn. And I figured out that I was failing at XCOM because of something I hadn’t known I didn’t know: specifically, smallunit tactics. When I started reading up on them, my XCOM game changed overnight.",
            "As I ran a fifth edition D&D campaign for my wife and her coworkers, I began to think something was missing in how I was running monsters and non-player characters in combat. Reflecting back on my XCOM experience, I decided I needed to understand those monsters and NPCs more deeply and to come up with action plans for them before, rather than during, our game sessions.",
            "Once I’d come up with these plans, it seemed selfish to keep them to myself. So I created a blog, The Monsters Know What They’re Doing (themonstersknow.com), where I analyzed the stat blocks of monster after monster for the benefit of other DMs, figuring that what was helpful to me might be helpful to them as well.",
            "I began writing The Monsters Know What They’re Doing in August 2016. Six months later, I noticed a spike in my traffic, seemingly driven by Reddit. Users of D&D-related subreddits were answering “How I do I run [monster x]?” questions by sharing links to my blog. Eventually, I realized that a growing number of other DMs were visiting my blog as a routine step in their combat encounter planning. The comments rolled in: “I love what you’re doing here.” “This resource is fantastic!” “Thank you for doing this. It’s saved me a lot of work.”",
            "I now have the honor of presenting The Monsters Know What They’re Doing to you in book form—consolidated, revised, in some cases corrected, and supplemented with additional material, including analyses of monsters not examined on the blog. Note well: This is not a substitute for the Monster Manual (or any other D&D core book); for the actual abilities, traits, and other stats of D&D monsters, as well as the official lore attached to them, you’ll need the Monster Manual. But if you want advice from a D&D veteran about what to do with those abilities, traits, and other stats when the fur starts to fly, The Monsters Know What They’re Doing is the book for you."

            "Any creature that has evolved to survive in a given environment instinctively knows how to make the best use of its particular adaptations.",
            "That seems like a straightforward principle, doesn’t it? Yet monsters in Dungeons & Dragons campaigns often fail to follow it.",
            "No doubt this is largely because many of us begin playing D&D when we’re teens (or even preteens) and don’t yet have much experience with how the world works. Or we come to D&D as adults with little or no background in evolutionary biology, military service, martial arts, or even tactical simulation games, so we don’t consider how relative strengths and weaknesses, the environment, and simple survival sense play into the way a creature fights, hunts, or defends itself. Consequently, we think of combat as a situation in which two opponents swing/shoot/claw/bite at each other until one or the other goes down or runs away. Not so.",
            "Primitive societies may fight battles by charging out into the open and stabbing at each other, but trained soldiers don’t. They use ranged weapons and shoot from cover. They strive to occupy high ground, where they can see farther and from which it’s easier to shoot or charge. While one soldier or fire team moves from cover to cover, another stays put and watches for danger; then they switch. They’ve learned this from centuries of experience with what wins a battle and what loses it. They know what they’re capable of, and they make the most of it. This is what makes them effective.",
            "What makes the predators of the natural world effective is evolution: behavior fine-tuned into instincts over countless generations. Lions, crocodiles, and bears are all potentially deadly to humans. Yet lions and crocodiles don’t charge at us from out in the open. They use cover and stealth, and they strike when they’re close enough that we have little chance of running away. This is their most effective strategy: A crocodile isn’t fast enough to give chase over land, and a lion will tire itself out before catching an impala or wildebeest if its prey has enough of a lead. Black and brown bears, which are also deadly up close—and are more than fast enough to chase a human down—use stealth hardly at all. Why? Because, by and large, they don’t hunt. They scavenge, forage, and fish. Their environment is different, and their diet is different, so their habits are different.",
            "In a game of D&D, what distinguishes goblins from kobolds from orcs from lizardfolk? In many campaigns, hardly anything. They’re all low-level humanoids who go, “Rrrrahhhh, stab stab stab,” then (if the player characters are above level 2) get wiped out. They’re cannon fodder. Only the packaging is different.",
            "Yet the simple fact that they have different names tells us there should be differences among them, including differences in behavior. One of the great things about the fifth edition of D&D is that not only the ability scores but the skills and features of monsters are specified precisely and consistently. Those skills and features give us clues as to how these monsters ought to fight.",
            "However, because a Dungeon Master has to make one decision after another in response to player behavior (and the better the players, the more unpredictable their behavior), it doesn’t take long for decision fatigue to set in. It’s easy for even an excellent DM, well acquainted with their monsters’ stat blocks and lore, to allow combat to devolve into monsters running directly at the PCs and going, “Rrrrahhhh, stab stab stab.”",
            "The way to avoid this is to make as many of these tactical decisions as possible before the session begins, just as a trained soldier—or an accomplished athlete or musician—relies on reflexes developed from thousands of hours of training and practice, and just as an animal acts from evolved instinct. A lion doesn’t wait until the moment after it first spots a herd of tasty wildebeests to reflect upon how it should go about nabbing one, soldiers don’t whip out their field manuals for the first time when they’re already under fire, and a DM shouldn’t be contemplating for the first time how bullywugs move and fight when the PCs have just encountered twelve of them. Rather than try to make those decisions on the fly, the DM needs heuristics to follow so that combat can progress smoothly, sensibly, and satisfyingly. That’s what I set out to provide in this book.",

If your PCs know something about the creatures they’re up against, they can begin to plan for it, and that’s part of the fun of D&D."
