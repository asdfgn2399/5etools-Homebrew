The September/October 1979 issue, though, seized my attention like no other had, because it included a feature article that described an entirely new kind of game—one involving maps, monsters, and hunting for treasure—called \"Dungeons & Dragons.\" I showed the article to my mother, and before long, I had the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set in my hands. It contained a rulebook, an adventure module called \"The Keep on the Borderlands,\" and a set of the exact same hard polymer polyhedral dice I'd seen advertised in my mom's teacher supply catalogs.","We sat down to play it, and… neither of us could figure out what to do.","It sat on my shelf for a long time.","Later, in high school, I got together with a group of friends who had figured it out and were playing D&D along with other roleplaying games such as Villains & Vigilantes and Call of Cthulhu. Four of us formed a tight group that played D&D, taking turns as Dungeon Master, starting with my friend Julian. I was last in the rotation, so I got to see three different examples of how to be a DM before taking on the job myself.","In those years, I didn't think of what we were doing in our D&D games in strategic or tactical terms. None of us did. We had plan A (\"Get 'em!\") and plan B (\"Run!\"), and that was the extent of it.","That group disbanded when, one by one, we stopped coming home from college over the summer. I kept playing D&D for a year or two after that in college, but I'd begun to lose interest in the high-fantasy roleplaying genre; then early adulthood hit, and multiple intercity moves in pursuit of work, and I never managed to find another gaming group that I clicked with. Eventually, I returned home to Chicago and reconnected with Julian and some other players—but by that time, they'd moved on from D&D as well. They were playing GURPS (the Generic Universal Role-Playing System), which worked with any genre, including fantasy.","Everything changed in 2015, when my wife came home from work one day and asked me whether I could help get a D&D game going with some of her coworkers. (Someone at her office had referred to a client as \"someone who looks like he'd play Dungeons & Dragons in his mother's basement,\" to which one of the aforementioned coworkers had replied, deadpan, \"I would totally play Dungeons & Dragons.\") My first thought was to run a fantasy campaign using GURPS, but my wife said her coworkers wanted to play D&D, and she prevailed on me to stick with the biggest name in roleplaying games.","I hadn't played D&D since shortly after the second edition of the game came out, and I hadn't kept any of my books, so I went to a friendly local game store and bought the D&D Starter Set. The timing couldn't have been better: Wizards of the Coast, which had bought the rights to D&D from its original publisher, TSR Inc., had recently released the fifth edition of the game. This edition had taken a hulking gallimaufry of accumulated rules and options and streamlined it into a tight, consistent system that treated all its core functions—attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks—the same way, reducing a plethora of lookup tables to simple calculations, while preserving the game's high-fantasy soul. The more I got into it, the more I liked it (even though I still favored anchored fantasy over wild, fantastic, superheroic fantasy). I also began to recognize certain emergent properties of some of fifth edition D&D's mechanics—properties with tactical implications.","As a young person, I'd always been interested in strategy games, but I'd also never been particularly good at them, because I never learned to think strategically. What really drove this fact home for me, a couple of years before discovering fifth edition D&D, was playing the computer game XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Over and over, I kept getting massacred, even on the easiest levels. What was I doing wrong? I had no idea. However, by that time, after many hard years, I had finally learned how to learn. And I figured out that I was failing at XCOM because of something I hadn't known I didn't know: specifically, smallunit tactics. When I started reading up on them, my XCOM game changed overnight.","As I ran a fifth edition D&D campaign for my wife and her coworkers, I began to think something was missing in how I was running monsters and non-player characters in combat. Reflecting back on my XCOM experience, I decided I needed to understand those monsters and NPCs more deeply and to come up with action plans for them before, rather than during, our game sessions.","Once I'd come up with these plans, it seemed selfish to keep them to myself. So I created a blog, The Monsters Know What They're Doing (themonstersknow.com), where I analyzed the stat blocks of monster after monster for the benefit of other DMs, figuring that what was helpful to me might be helpful to them as well.","I began writing The Monsters Know What They're Doing in August 2016. Six months later, I noticed a spike in my traffic, seemingly driven by Reddit. Users of D&D-related subreddits were answering \"How I do I run [monster x]?\" questions by sharing links to my blog. Eventually, I realized that a growing number of other DMs were visiting my blog as a routine step in their combat encounter planning. The comments rolled in: \"I love what you're doing here.\" \"This resource is fantastic!\" \"Thank you for doing this. It's saved me a lot of work.\"","I now have the honor of presenting The Monsters Know What They're Doing to you in book form—consolidated, revised, in some cases corrected, and supplemented with additional material, including analyses of monsters not examined on the blog. Note well: This is not a substitute for the Monster Manual (or any other D&D core book); for the actual abilities, traits, and other stats of D&D monsters, as well as the official lore attached to them, you'll need the Monster Manual. But if you want advice from a D&D veteran about what to do with those abilities, traits, and other stats when the fur starts to fly, The Monsters Know What They're Doing is the book for you."]},{"type":"section","name":"Introduction","page":6,"entries":["Any creature that has evolved to survive in a given environment instinctively knows how to make the best use of its particular adaptations.","That seems like a straightforward principle, doesn't it? Yet monsters in Dungeons & Dragons campaigns often fail to follow it.","No doubt this is largely because many of us begin playing D&D when we're teens (or even preteens) and don't yet have much experience with how the world works. Or we come to D&D as adults with little or no background in evolutionary biology, military service, martial arts, or even tactical simulation games, so we don't consider how relative strengths and weaknesses, the environment, and simple survival sense play into the way a creature fights, hunts, or defends itself. Consequently, we think of combat as a situation in which two opponents swing/shoot/claw/bite at each other until one or the other goes down or runs away. Not so.","Primitive societies may fight battles by charging out into the open and stabbing at each other, but trained soldiers don't. They use ranged weapons and shoot from cover. They strive to occupy high ground, where they can see farther and from which it's easier to shoot or charge. While one soldier or fire team moves from cover to cover, another stays put and watches for danger; then they switch. They've learned this from centuries of experience with what wins a battle and what loses it. They know what they're capable of, and they make the most of it. This is what makes them effective.","What makes the predators of the natural world effective is evolution: behavior fine-tuned into instincts over countless generations. Lions, crocodiles, and bears are all potentially deadly to humans. Yet lions and crocodiles don't charge at us from out in the open. They use cover and stealth, and they strike when they're close enough that we have little chance of running away. This is their most effective strategy: A crocodile isn't fast enough to give chase over land, and a lion will tire itself out before catching an impala or wildebeest if its prey has enough of a lead. Black and brown bears, which are also deadly up close—and are more than fast enough to chase a human down—use stealth hardly at all. Why? Because, by and large, they don't hunt. They scavenge, forage, and fish. Their environment is different, and their diet is different, so their habits are different.","In a game of D&D, what distinguishes goblins from kobolds from orcs from lizardfolk? In many campaigns, hardly anything. They're all low-level humanoids who go, \"Rrrrahhhh, stab stab stab,\" then (if the player characters are above level 2) get wiped out. They're cannon fodder. Only the packaging is different.","Yet the simple fact that they have different names tells us there should be differences among them, including differences in behavior. One of the great things about the fifth edition of D&D is that not only the ability scores but the skills and features of monsters are specified precisely and consistently. Those skills and features give us clues as to how these monsters ought to fight.","However, because a Dungeon Master has to make one decision after another in response to player behavior (and the better the players, the more unpredictable their behavior), it doesn't take long for decision fatigue to set in. It's easy for even an excellent DM, well acquainted with their monsters' stat blocks and lore, to allow combat to devolve into monsters running directly at the PCs and going, \"Rrrrahhhh, stab stab stab.\"","The way to avoid this is to make as many of these tactical decisions as possible before the session begins, just as a trained soldier—or an accomplished athlete or musician—relies on reflexes developed from thousands of hours of training and practice, and just as an animal acts from evolved instinct. A lion doesn't wait until the moment after it first spots a herd of tasty wildebeests to reflect upon how it should go about nabbing one, soldiers don't whip out their field manuals for the first time when they're already under fire, and a DM shouldn't be contemplating for the first time how bullywugs move and fight when the PCs have just encountered twelve of them. Rather than try to make those decisions on the fly, the DM needs heuristics to follow so that combat can progress smoothly, sensibly, and satisfyingly. That's what I set out to provide in this book.","This book is aimed at:",{"type":"list","page":8,"items":["Beginning DMs, especially younger DMs and adult DMs with little or no strategy gaming experience","Intermediate DMs who are looking for ways to add more flavor and challenge for their players","Advanced DMs who could figure all this out perfectly well on their own but are too busy to put the time into it","And players. Yes, players! I don't see anything wrong with your scoping this book for intel. If your DM is using these tips, it's going to make your characters' lives a little tougher, and I don't want them to get slaughtered. If your PCs know something about the creatures they're up against, they can begin to plan for it, and that's part of the fun of D&D."]}]},{"type":"section","name":"Why These Tactics?","page":9,"entries":["To analyze the stat blocks of the creatures in the Monster Manual and other books, I proceed from a certain set of assumptions:",{"type":"list","page":9,"items":["With only a small number of exceptions (mostly constructs and undead), every creature wants, first and foremost, to survive. Seriously wounded creatures will try to flee, unless they're fanatics or intelligent beings who believe they'll be hunted down and killed if they do flee. Some creatures will flee even sooner.","Ability scores, particularly physical ability scores, influence fighting styles. In this book, I use the phrase \"ability contour\" to refer to the pattern of high and low scores in a creature's stat block and how it defines that creature's overall approach to combat. Two key elements in a creature's ability contour are its primary defensive ability and primary offensive ability. The primary defensive ability is either Constitution or Dexterity, and it determines whether a creature relies on its toughness to absorb incoming damage or on its nimbleness and mobility to avoid it. The primary offensive ability may be Strength, Dexterity, or a mental ability, and it determines whether a creature prefers to do damage via brute-force melee attacks, finesse or ranged attacks, or magical powers. Small, low-Strength creatures try to compensate with numbers, and when their numbers are reduced enough, they scatter. Low-Constitution creatures prefer to attack from range, from hiding, or both. Low-Dexterity creatures must choose their battles judiciously, because they're not likely to be able to get out of a fight once they're in it. High-Strength, high-Constitution creatures are brutes that welcome a close-quarters slugfest. High-Strength, high-Dexterity creatures are hard-hitting predators or shock attackers that count on finishing fights quickly; they'll often use Stealth and go for bigdamage ambushes. High-Dexterity, high-Constitution creatures are scrappy skirmishers that deal steady, moderate damage and don't mind a battle of attrition. High-Dexterity creatures without high Strength or Constitution snipe at range with missile weapons or spells. If all three physical abilities are low, a creature seeks to avoid fighting altogether unless it has some sort of circumstantial advantage—or it simply flees without hesitation.","A creature with Intelligence 7 or less operates wholly or almost wholly from instinct. This doesn't mean it uses its features ineffectively, only that it has one preferred modus operandi and can't adjust if it stops working. A creature with Intelligence 8 to 11 is unsophisticated in its tactics and largely lacking in strategy, but it can tell when things are going wrong and adjust to some degree. A creature with Intelligence 12 or higher can come up with a good plan and coordinate with others; it probably also has multiple ways of attacking and/or defending and knows which works better in which situation. A creature with Intelligence 14 or higher can not only plan but also accurately assess its enemies' weaknesses and target accordingly. (A creature with Intelligence greater than 18 can do this to a superhuman degree, detecting even hidden weaknesses.)","A creature with Wisdom 7 or less has an underdeveloped survival instinct and may wait too long to flee. A creature with Wisdom 8 to 11 knows when to flee but is indiscriminate in choosing targets to attack. A creature with Wisdom 12 or higher selects targets carefully and may even refrain from combat in favor of parley if it recognizes that it's outmatched. A creature with Wisdom 14 or higher chooses its battles, fights only when it's sure it will win (or will be killed if it doesn't fight), and is always willing to bargain, bully, or bluff if this will further its interests with less resistance.","Creatures that rely on numbers have an instinctive sense of how many of them are needed to take down a foe. Usually this is at least three to one. This sense isn't perfect, but it's accurate given certain base assumptions (which player characters may defy). The smarter a creature is, the more it accounts for such things as its target's armor, weaponry, and behavior; the stupider it is, the more it bases its estimate of the danger its enemy poses solely on physical size.","A creature with a feature that gives it advantage on a roll (or gives its enemy disadvantage) will always prefer to use that feature. If it uses such a feature to initiate combat and the circumstances aren't right for it, it may never attack in the first place. On average, advantage or disadvantage is worth approximately ±4 on a d20 roll; with midrange target numbers, it can be worth as much as ±5. It can turn a fifty-fifty chance into three-to-one odds, or three-to-one odds into fifteen-to-one odds… or the reverse. By comparison, the rarest and most powerful magic weapons in fifth edition D&D are +3. Advantage and disadvantage are a big deal!","A creature with a feature that requires a saving throw to avoid will often favor this feature over a simple attack, even if the average damage may be slightly less. This is because the presumption of an attack action is failure, and the burden is on the attacker to prove success; the presumption of a feature that requires a saving throw is success, and the burden is on the defender to prove failure. Moreover, attacks that miss do no damage at all, ever; features that require saving throws often have damaging effects even if the targets succeed on their saves.","In fifth edition Dungeons & Dragons, unless otherwise specified, any creature gets one action and up to one bonus action in a combat round, plus movement and up to one reaction. Any creature that exists in the D&D game world will have evolved in accordance with this rule: It seeks to obtain the best possible result from whatever movement, actions, bonus actions, and reactions are available to it. If it can combine two of them for a superior outcome, it will. This principle is widely referred to as \"action economy,\" and that's how I refer to it here.","I make frequent reference to the Targets in Area of Effect table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. It's intended primarily for resolution of area-effect spells and other abilities in \"theater of the mind\"–style play, but here I use it as a guide to the minimum number of targets against whom a limited-use area-effect spell or feature is worth using. For instance, if the table indicates four creatures in a spell's area of effect, I conclude that the caster is disinclined to waste it against three or fewer if it has any other reasonable choice of action.","Good creatures tend to be friendly by default, neutral creatures indifferent, and evil creatures hostile. However, lawful creatures, even lawful good creatures, will be hostile toward chaotic creatures causing ruckus; chaotic creatures, even chaotic good creatures, will be hostile toward attempts by lawful creatures to constrain or interfere with them; and nearly all creatures, regardless of alignment, are territorial to some degree or another. Intelligent lawful monsters may try to capture and either imprison or enslave characters whom intelligent chaotic monsters would simply drive off or kill.","I consider a creature that's lost 10 percent of its average hit point maximum to be lightly wounded, 30 percent moderately wounded, and 60 percent severely wounded. I use these thresholds to determine whether a creature will flee or otherwise alter its behavior or attitude toward its opponents. Except in rare and specific cases (such as trolls using the \"Loathsome Limbs\" variant rule), they don't affect what the creature can do."]},{"type":"inset","page":13,"name":"Caveat Arbiter (Not all monsters' tactics are inresting)","entries":["Despite what I say about monsters knowing the best way to make use of their features and traits, the sad truth is that there are some monsters, including a few I've omitted from this book, whose features and traits don't lend themselves to anything but \"Rrrraaaahhhh, stab stab stab.\" Most of these are brutes with only one means of attack, no special movement, and no feature synergy to give them any kind of advantage. Some could pose a special threat to particular opponents but don't, because they're too stupid to distinguish one opponent from another. Some are simplistic in a different way: They're too weak and fragile to do anything but run away when encountered.","The fact that the monster isn't interesting doesn't absolve you of the need to make the encounter interesting. Keep the following in mind when the situation that you're devising (or that appears in a published adventure) calls for a tactically dull monster:",{"type":"list","items":["Sometimes monsters exist just to soften the PCs up, increasing the danger level of a subsequent encounter. When this is the case, make them weaker and more numerous. This way, the monsters' lack of sophistication is obscured by the challenge of having to fend off a horde of them. If there's no weaker version of the monster you're looking at, reduce its hit points to something at the lower end of its range (remember, you don't have to use the default average hit points or roll for them—you can assign any value within the random range).","Sometimes a monster is narratively and/or thematically appropriate but otherwise not that interesting. Find other ways to enliven the encounter, such as unusual terrain that the PCs can exploit to outmaneuver a less mobile brute, environmental hazards, distracting developments taking place around the combatants, or an item that the PCs want and the monster has taken (or eaten).","Sometimes a monster is less of an enemy and more of an obstacle. Offer your PCs two or three ways around it that they can discover if they're creative. A monster encounter doesn't always have to be a combat encounter.","Sometimes monsters fight other monsters! Not every fight has to be two-sided. Introduce a more complex monster as a foil for the simpler one—and for your PCs. Your players will delight in the chaos of a three-way battle.","If no other solution presents itself, let the battle end quickly, so that you and your players can move on to more interesting things."]}]}]},{"type":"section","name":"What Monsters Want","page":15,"entries":["Fifth edition Dungeons & Dragons organizes monsters into fourteen different types. In most cases, a monster's type is an excellent indicator of its basic goals and desires.","Beasts and monstrosities are easily grouped together, because their priorities are simple: They want food. Also, perhaps, territory, but territory is mainly a way to ensure uncontested access to food, along with individual survival. Monstrosities tend to have animal-level intelligence, although there are a handful of exceptions, notably krakens, sphinxes, nagas, lamias, and those yuan-ti that are considered monstrosities rather than humanoids. Even these exceptions will possess an animal-like instinct to establish and defend territory, despite coming up with more sophisticated rationalizations for this behavior. Combat with a beast or a monstrosity most often occurs for one of four reasons: It's trying to eat you; you're hunting it because it's been eating something or someone else; you've stumbled onto its turf, and it feels threatened; or another foe is employing it as a watchbeast.","Dragons are über-monstrosities with distinctive personalities. They want food and territory, but they also crave two more things: treasure and domination. The treasure thing is a compulsion, because it's not as though they're going shopping with all those hoarded coins and gems. They like beautiful, expensive things, and they want them—end of story. They also have a deep-seated desire to demonstrate their superiority over other beings. Although they generally don't have any interest in the practical aspects of ruling, they're quite fond of being rulers, and they think they're entitled to it. Thus, they may act like mafia bosses over a region, extorting wealth in exchange for \"protection,\" by which they mainly mean protection from them. Even good-aligned dragons share this tendency, although their rule is benevolent rather than exploitative.","Other creatures in the dragon family lack either the power or the intelligence to dominate other beings in the way that true dragons do, but they still exhibit draconic avarice and wrath in the limited ways they're capable of. Pseudodragons gather shiny objects like magpies, wyverns exhibit dominance behaviors as they hunt and fight, and so forth.","Humanoid enemies (as opposed to humanoids just going about their business) are driven by the things you don't talk about at the dinner table: politics and religion. They're social creatures, and therefore their goals are typically social in nature, as are the units they form to bring these goals about. A humanoid boss enemy is a leader of like-minded humanoids who all want the same thing, and the sophistication and abstraction of the goal is proportional to the intelligence of the humanoid(s) pursuing it. Although they may still be fundamentally interested in territory, wealth, and domination, it's shared territory, wealth, and domination, and the superficial justifications for those pursuits take the form of ideologies built around tribal, clan, or national identity; moral or theological doctrine; sex or gender roles; caste roles; hierarchies of rulership and allegiance; or rules of trade. The psychologist Jonathan Haidt's moral foundations (fairness, kindness, loyalty, obedience, and sanctity) and their opposites (injustice, abuse, treachery, rebellion, and corruption) come into play: The \"bad guys\" may be committing one or more of the latter group of sins, or they may be going overboard in their attempts to root those sins out.","If dragons are über-monstrosities, then giants are über-humanoids. However, while dragons have broader interests than most monstrosities do, giants' interests tend to be narrower than those of most humanoids, and they're tightly dictated by their species and their place in the Ordning—the giants' status hierarchy. In terms of social ideology, giants are chiefly interested in their relationships with other giants, and this impinges upon humanoid society only to the extent that giants need to claim humanoids' territory, humanoids' wealth, humanoids' food supplies, or rulership over a humanoid group in order to establish their intragigantic status. In other words, giants' goals revolve around rivalries, and when this makes them the villains, it's usually because of the collateral damage they're causing around them.","Undead creatures are driven by compulsions generated by whatever spell, influence, or event caused them to rise from the dead. The simplest undead creatures are compelled by the orders of whoever or whatever controls them (or once controlled them). Ghosts are compelled by the need to resolve unfinished business. Other mid- and high-level undead are compelled by hunger, malice, and megalomania. Whatever the compulsion of an undead creature, everything it does revolves around that compulsion and serves it in some way. It supersedes everything else, sometimes including the creature's continued existence.","Celestials and fiends are two sides of the same coin. They're embodiments of good and evil, but they're not just quasi-humanoids that meander through everyday situations and always do the good or evil thing. They're concerned with cosmic order, and their goals revolve around purification and corruption. Celestials aren't just about doing good things—they're about purging evil influences. Fiends aren't just about doing bad things—they're about introducing evil influences, tempting people to do wicked things they might not otherwise do. For these reasons, while celestial and fiend goals differ from humanoid goals, they make excellent complements to these goals. The involvement of a fiend might push a group of humanoids to take their ideological pursuits in an evil direction—or desperate humanoids might enlist the aid of a fiend in the pursuit of their goal, corrupting them and their goal in the process. Celestial involvement in humanoid affairs is a trickier needle to thread, and if you're going to make a celestial into a villain, it's almost by necessity going to have to be misinformed or overzealous—or corrupted and on the verge of a fall.","Aberrations, by definition, are beings whose ultimate goals make no sense to us, and for this reason, coming up with decent, plausible schemes for aberration villains can be challenging. Fall back on conventional schemes of domination, and you risk making your aberration into a funny-looking humanoid, for all intents and purposes. An aberration's behavior has to be weird. But also, for an aberration to be a villain rather than a mere curiosity, it has to pose some kind of threat. A good solution for aberrations with mind-control powers is to have them brainwashing ordinary people into participating in their weird schemes. No one wants to be a part of that. Aberrations' activities can have deleterious side effects on nearby habitations. Maybe they're causing nightmares, spooking livestock (the livestock are always first to know when bad juju is going down), disrupting the local economy with excessive demand for some random commodity, or using up a natural resource. Or maybe, like the stereotypical gray alien, they're abducting people, probing them with weird devices, then returning them to their homes. Aberrations' behavior doesn't have to make obvious sense—although, in at least some respects, it should make internal sense.","Fey creatures' goals, in terms of how much sense they make to an outside observer, aren't all that different from those of aberrations. However, while aberrations' goals are simply inscrutable, fey goals always have a clear emotional or aesthetic aspect, something that might not make logical sense but would seem perfectly sensible in a dream or to a child. Mischief is common; outright malice is unusual. The seven deadly sins are all well represented, however, as is every primary or secondary emotion, turned up to 11. A fey antagonist is an id without an ego to ground it. No matter how large or small the scale of a fey's goals, they're always personal, and the motivations behind them are explainable, if not excusable.","Constructs don't have goals, only instructions—specifically, the last instructions they were given. When the instructions no longer fit the circumstances, they sometimes go haywire trying to resolve unresolvable contradictions.","Oozes don't have goals either; they're sub-beasts that aren't even interested in territory, just food. Most plants are the same, although there are a small number of monsters categorized as plants that possess above-animal intelligence. Even an intelligent plant, however, is unlikely to possess any goal beyond survival, selfpropagation, and protection of its environment; it simply develops more sophisticated means of pursuing these goals, ones that involve understanding other creatures, anticipating causation, and planning for the future. Cursed plants, like blights, have a wee dram of undead-ish compulsion in their mentalities.","That leaves elementals, which I find the hardest type to sum up. They're not full-on alien, like aberrations; simple, like beasts and monstrosities; mechanistic, like constructs; nor defined by their social structures, like humanoids. What they are, I think, is temperamental, in the sense that they're defined by temperaments associated with their elements. However, the classical humors, which you'd think might be a natural fit for this purpose, aren't. While it's easy to imagine elemental beings of fire as choleric (i.e., bad-tempered and irritable) and their goals as primarily involving destroying things out of anger, phlegmatic water elementals, melancholy earth elementals, and sanguine air elementals fit poorly in adventure narratives and feel off base, somehow. Traits drawn from Chinese astrology and traditional medicine fit better—elemental beings of fire being angry and volatile, those of water being aimless and impulsive, those of earth being stolid and hidebound—but they offer us no insight into air, which isn't one of the five wǔ xíng elements. It looks like we have to abandon ancient natural philosophy and rely on our imaginations.","In both literal and figurative senses, elementals are forces of nature, difficult for ordinary mortals to redirect once they get going. There has to be a sense of out-of-controlness about them, even—perhaps especially—the intelligent ones, like genies. We all share a pretty good sense that elemental beings of fire are about burning everything down, but what can we intuitively say about the rest? Elemental beings of earth want to solidify, to suffocate, to entomb—at least metaphorically, if not literally. Elemental beings of water are the flood, the tsunami—inexorable forces carrying away anything and anyone that's not tightly secured, whether it be a seaside village or people's common sense. Elemental beings of air are entropic—they want to scatter what's ordered, create disarray, rearrange everything, then rearrange it again, the opposite of their earthy complements, which seek to hold everything in place. In this respect, they're a bit like fey, except that fey can be reasoned with, if you know the rules of their antilogic, while elementals can't.","All the tactics I discuss in this book describe how to use a monster's features effectively, considering what it's capable of. The monster's type, as described here, tells us why the monster is doing what it's doing. Ultimately, a monster's choices, in or out of combat, are a function of this motivation, and when you're writing your own adventures, you should use this information not only to generate plot— to determine why your monster is a threat in the first place—but also to contemplate in advance how your monster is going to react when it realizes that the player characters aren't going to let it have what it wants."]},{"type":"section","name":"Humanoids","page":23,"entries":["Dungeons & Dragons is chock-full of low-challenge humanoid creatures, which inexperienced Dungeon Masters may not bother to distinguish from one another —an unhappy oversight, because their differences are key to making these encounters memorable.

They're low-Strength and high-Dexterity, with a very good {@skill Stealth} modifier. Their Intelligence and Wisdom are in the average range. They possess {@sense darkvision} and the Nimble Escape feature, which allows them to {@action Disengage} or Hide as a bonus action—very important to their action economy.","Because of their {@sense darkvision}, goblins frequently attack under cover of darkness, when their targets may be effectively {@condition blinded} (attack rolls against a {@condition blinded} creature have advantage, while the {@condition blinded} creature's attack rolls have disadvantage). They'll also attack from hiding as much as possible, making use of their high {@skill Stealth} modifier, and doing so in dim light decreases the likelihood that they'll be discovered, since many player characters will have disadvantage on {@skill Perception} checks that rely on sight.","A picture of goblin combat is starting to coalesce, and at the center of it is a strategy of ambush.","A typical goblin combat turn goes Shortbow (action), move, {@action Hide} (bonus action). Because they attack from hiding, they roll with advantage. Regardless of whether they hit or miss, the attack gives their position away, so they change it immediately, because they can. (The sequence is important. Whenever possible, a goblin must end its turn hidden; otherwise, it's vulnerable. Move/{@action Hide}/Shortbow would achieve the same offensive result but leave the goblin exposed to retaliation between turns.)","Being a Small creature, a goblin has a good chance of Hiding successfully behind the trunk of a mature tree; even if it fails, it will still enjoy three-quarters cover (+5 AC). But since you can't hide while someone is looking directly at you, goblins have to use their movement to scramble out of the PCs' field of view, meaning they have to be close enough for their own 30-foot movement speed to describe a significant arc. At the same time, they don't want to be so close that a PC could close the gap between them and attack. So the optimal distance from the targets of their ambush is about 40 feet, no closer—and they don't want to move farther from the PCs than 80 feet, their bows' maximum range for normal shooting.","As long as they can stay out of the PCs' reach, they'll use this tactic over and over. Suppose, however, that a PC does manage to close with one of them. In that case, the goblin Disengages (bonus action) first. Then, depending on how great a threat the PC poses, it either Dashes (action) out of reach—forcing the PC to use a {@action Dash} action as well if they want to catch up—or, if it thinks it may be able to finish the PC off, moves its full distance to a place of cover, then Hides (action) again, preparing to attack with advantage on its next turn.","Incidentally, the goblins aren't trying to stay together as a group. They aren't looking out for their buddies—goblins don't do that sort of thing. They are, however, trying to goad the PCs into splitting up.","Goblins are squishy: They have only 7 hp. One good hit will seriously wound them—and also mean that their genius sniping strategy has failed. Therefore, a goblin reduced to just 1 or 2 hp flees the scene, end of story. But a moderately wounded goblin (3 or 4 hp) is thirsty and tries to regain the upper hand. It stalks the PC who wounded it, first retreating to a safe distance, then Hiding and moving with {@skill Stealth} until it can get back to around 40 feet from its quarry, at which point it returns to its Shortbow/move/{@action Hide} sniping tactic. A captured goblin surrenders immediately and grovels for mercy, counting on its ability to escape as soon as its captor's attention wanders.","What if the PCs have the good sense to take cover themselves? Goblins aren't brilliant, but they aren't stupid either. They won't waste arrows on a target that's behind three-quarters cover, because that would completely negate the advantage they gain when shooting from hiding. Instead, a goblin stealthily repositions itself alongside or behind its target before shooting and giving its own position away.","A goblin that finishes off its target doesn't immediately go hunting after other targets. If another is already in view, it attacks that one. If not, the greedy goblin first ransacks the body of its victim for anything valuable. A clever and stealthy PC who's counter-stalking the goblins can exploit this weakness.","So far, the entire discussion has been about ranged attacks. Goblins carry scimitars as well, but they don't use these out in the open, because there's no advantage to it. The only time a goblin willingly engages in melee combat is when it has some other overwhelming advantage, such as a combination of numbers, darkness, and the ability to flank, which in fifth edition D&D means attacking from two opposite sides of a target creature. (Front-and-side isn't enough to gain advantage on attack rolls. See \"Optional Rule: Flanking,\" Dungeon Master's Guide, chapter 8.)","A goblin's +4 attack modifier isn't quite good enough to give it two-to-one odds of hitting an armored enemy by itself, but when advantage is brought into play, a hit is almost guaranteed. If three goblins surround a PC in the dark, the chances are very good that they'll land three hits and not have to worry about retaliation. That being said, if those three hits don't finish the PC off, the goblins will realize that they've bitten off more than they can chew, and on their next turn, they'll {@action Disengage} (bonus action), go scampering off into the darkness (movement), and {@action Hide} (action) someplace where they may later be able to land a surprise hit on a wounded foe.","Also, goblins can tell the difference between a creature that's lost in the dark and one that has {@sense darkvision}. They won't attack the latter close up if they can avoid it; instead, they'll prefer to shoot with their shortbows. However, in the narrow passages of a cave, establishing a good line of sight may not always be possible, and melee may be the only way to attack. If this happens, they'll use their knowledge of the terrain to tease the party into overextending itself: A lead goblin may use its Scimitar attack (action), {@action Disengage} (bonus action), then retreat down the passageway (movement) until it comes out into a more open cavern where it and several other goblins can all jump the first PC who emerges with Readied attack actions. Meanwhile, while the PCs are being drawn forward, other goblins may shoot or stab at them opportunistically from any side passages that exist along the way.","There is one other circumstance when goblins may engage in melee fighting: when commanded to do so by hobgoblins or bugbears, which goblins fear and defer to. They'll do it, but they won't like it. They know they're not good at it; they'd rather be sniping. If pressed into an infantry unit, they'll fight without coordination and desert at the first opportunity. However, that doesn't mean they won't keep attacking if they think there's something to be gained by doing it their way.","Goblins recognize the value of stealth and surprise, and they're not about to let anyone get the same advantage against them. They make extensive use of alarms and traps, but since they're not great inventors, by and large, most of these are crude: metal junk that makes a racket when disturbed, falling rocks, pits (with or without punji sticks), simple snares. Every once in a while, though, a lucky goblin may get its hands on a hunter's trap that both restrains its victim and does damage. These are prized possessions, and the goblins use them to protect their most important locations."]},{"type":"entries","name":"{@creature Goblin Boss|TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing}","page":26,"entries":["The goblin boss is distinguished from ordinary goblins by its Multiattack and Redirect Attack features and by the fact that it doesn't use a bow. Additionally, the Redirect Attack action is useful only in a context in which goblins are fighting side by side rather than in an ambush or skirmish. Based on this, I conclude that goblin bosses are found only in goblin lairs—caves, ruins, what have you—where large numbers of goblins can fight in close quarters.","By the way, have you read that Redirect Attack feature? The goblin boss uses its reaction to avoid a hit on itself and to cause it to land on one of its goblin minions instead. What a jerk! Here's a critter that's stronger, better at absorbing damage, and capable of landing more blows than most of its kind, and yet it possesses no notion of carrying the team. \"Aw, sorry about that, Jixto!

Fighting in a group, it begins on the front line with everyone else, using its Multiattack action to attack twice with its scimitar (note that the goblin boss's Multiattack has disadvantage on the second swing). As soon as it's taken even one hit, however, it changes tactics: After its Multiattack action, it Disengages (bonus action) and moves 15 feet to a position behind the front line where melee opponents can't reach it and it has \"meat cover\" against ranged attacks. On subsequent rounds, it moves up to 15 feet into a nearby hole in the front line, Multiattacks (action), Disengages (bonus action), and moves back behind the front line again. (If there's no actual hole, remember that it can move through a square occupied by an ally as if it were difficult terrain. Thus, it has just enough movement speed to go through the front line, and back, if it has to.)","If the goblin boss's minions are wiped out, it's out of there, and ditto if it's seriously wounded (reduced to 8 hp or fewer)."]},{"type":"entries","name":"{@creature Hobgoblin|TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing}","page":27,"entries":["Hobgoblins are very different from goblins—they're natural soldiers, tough and disciplined where goblins are squishy, lazy, and craven. They have no physical weakness, they're intelligent enough to make and use swords and bows and to conduct reconnaissance, and their Martial Advantage trait gives them bonus damage for fighting in close formation. On the other hand, they have no {@skill Stealth} proficiency and no Nimble Escape.","Hobgoblins move and attack at night, when their {@sense darkvision} gives them an advantage over PCs without it; if they don't have the advantage of darkness, they'll attack only with at least a two-to-one numerical advantage. In groups consisting only of hobgoblins, they move in tight teams of four to six. If there are multiple such teams, one consists of archers, positioned between 60 and 150 feet from the action. With goblin troops, they have to be careful: Hobgoblins don't lack the courage to fight on the front line, but they know that goblins do. Rather than set an example that the goblins won't follow, they give commands from behind the front line, where they can keep an eye on the goblins and shoot at opponents with their longbows. Martial Advantage helps them in this instance, even though they're not engaged in melee themselves, as long as they're choosing targets that the goblins are engaging in melee.","The more hobgoblin teams that are engaged in melee, the more sophisticated tactics they'll use. For instance, if there are three, one engages directly, one shoots from a distance, and one moves to whichever flank looks weaker before engaging. If there are four, one moves to each flank. Five or more try to encircle the PCs. These movements take place before the battle begins—hobgoblins are intelligent and disciplined enough to prepare. They also take place at a sufficient distance that their lack of {@skill Stealth} won't be a hindrance.","Hobgoblins don't flee when they're losing; they execute an orderly retreat. When at least two hobgoblins in a team are seriously injured (reduced to 4 hp or fewer) or killed, the team begins to fall back, starting with the most injured hobgoblins. These {@action Disengage} and retreat at their full movement speed. On the next round, the two next-most injured {@action Disengage} and also retreat at their full movement speed, while the previous two fall back only 5 feet, so as to remain in contact with the hobgoblins that are now joining them. Meanwhile, in this round, the hobgoblin archer team, if there is one, notices the retreat and focuses its arrows on any potential pursuers, in order to cover the retreat. On the third round, any hobgoblins left in the team {@action Disengage} and retreat at full movement speed, joining up with those that have already retreated. They carry out this same maneuver repeatedly, until no enemy is engaging with them anymore.","Despite being the very model of discipline otherwise, according to the Monster Manual, hobgoblins flip their lids when they see an elf. They attack elves first, \"even if doing so would be a tactical error.\" Does this mean they'll charge into combat prematurely, during daylight, with inadequate reconnaissance, just because they see an elf in the party's camp? That's the DM's call. You could play them this way, but given the extent to which they're built up as being militarily savvy, I'd say that before the action starts, their disciplined nature prevails—they simply construct their battle plans around taking out the elves first. Once the battle commences, though, maybe they allow a human warrior to score free hits on them while they concentrate their attacks on an elf warrior. Maybe the hobgoblin archers keep shooting at an elf mage when they should be covering their fellow hobgoblins' retreat. Maybe the sudden appearance of an elf rogue in its midst causes a hobgoblin melee group to forget what it was doing entirely and fixate on getting that elf.

It can Shield Bash to knock an opponent {@condition prone}, and it can Parry a melee blow.","Parry adds +3 to AC as a reaction, so the decision of when to use it is easy: when a player rolls between 20 and 22 on an attack (assuming the hobgoblin warlord hasn't already used its reaction on something else, of course).","Shield Bash requires a little math to analyze. The hobgoblin warlord's Multiattack allows three consecutive melee swings in one action. The Longsword attack does the most damage, so it's the default, but when is Shield Bash a reasonable alternative? Assuming a hit, Shield Bash does, on average, 2 hp less damage than a Longsword attack, so the crux is whether the chance to knock the opponent {@condition prone} is worth these forfeited points. Attacks against a {@condition prone} opponent have advantage, which raises the probability of a hit by an average of about 20 percentage points. If the hobgoblin warlord uses the Multiattack sequence Shield Bash/Longsword/Longsword, this means it will have advantage on two Longsword attacks after a successful bash. The longsword does an {@footnote average of 8 damage on a hit|In fifth edition D&D play, the general rule is to round fractions down. In this book, while analyzing damage probabilistically rather than applying it to a PC or monster, I round fractions to the nearest whole number, with one-half rounded to the nearest even whole number.}, 15 damage on two. Twenty percent of that is 3, so using Shield Bash before striking twice with a longsword increases the expected damage of those two hits by 3 hp—if it works.","The trouble is, the DC 14 for Strength saving throws against a Shield Bash isn't very high. Unmodified, the hobgoblin warlord has just shy of a two-thirds chance of knocking its opponent down. Modified by the opponent's Strength—and keep in mind that it's probably the party's toughest front-line fighters who'll confront the hobgoblin warlord—the chance of success recedes to the neighborhood of fifty-fifty, even less against PCs who get to add their proficiency modifiers to their Strength saves.","Hobgoblins aren't dumb; hobgoblin warlords even less so. They know from experience that a weak opponent (one with a negative Strength modifier) usually won't withstand a Shield Bash, but a stronger opponent often will. However, they also know that if one or more of their allies can land melee attacks on a {@condition prone} target before they get up—if the advantage applies to their allies' attack rolls as well, not just to the hobgoblin warlord's two attacks—then the expected value of Shield Bash is much more likely to exceed its opportunity cost. Also, in most instances, if an ally of a hobgoblin warlord is near enough to take whacks at its target, it's near enough for the warlord's Martial Advantage trait to kick in, which nearly triples the average damage of one of its Longsword attacks and roughly doubles the average total of the two together. Plus, if the ally is also a hobgoblin, its own Martial Advantage comes into play as well. Add it all together, and the Shield Bash tactic becomes effective enough to try even when it has as little as a one-in-three chance of success."]},{"type":"entries","name":"{@creature Bugbear|TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing}","page":30,"entries":["Bugbears are even stronger than hobgoblins, but they lack hobgoblins' intelligence and discipline.

Bugbears are stealthy, too, so despite being brute fighters, they fit in well with the ambush strategy that goblins employ. The difference is, while goblins engage in hit-and-run sniper attacks, the bugbear lies hidden until its foe comes within reach (or creeps up on its foe unseen until it comes within reach), then springs out and smashes it to a pulp. It's indiscriminate in its target selection: It attacks whoever it can get at first. It doesn't distinguish between targets that look weaker and targets that look stronger. To the bugbear, they all look weak.","Bugbears carry two weapons: morning star and javelin.

If one is seriously wounded (reduced to 10 hp or fewer), it will become confused and flee, using the {@action Dash} action and potentially exposing itself to one or more opportunity attacks.

That's the crux of how kobolds ought to fight. Kobold society has evolved to be highly cooperative. Unlike goblins, forever squabbling and looking out for themselves, kobolds instinctively work together, even without having to discuss what they're doing.","A kobold attack begins as an ambush: Hiding kobolds (which aren't exceptionally stealthy but may gain the element of surprise anyway, since they have decently high Dexterity and live in dark places) pop up and pelt the party with sling stones from 20 to 30 feet away in order to soften them up. This lasts until either the player characters close with the kobolds or the kobolds have lost any advantage they had, such as the PCs being {@condition restrained} by a trap or {@condition blinded} by darkness.

At this point, any hostile action on the PCs' part, including moving closer than 30 feet for any reason, ends the parley immediately and initiates combat.","However, a smooth talker may be able to stave off an attack by making a Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check with disadvantage—against DC 15, say, or maybe DC 20 if the orcs are there for a specific purpose, such as guarding something or staking a territorial claim. If it succeeds, the orcs' attitude shifts from hostile to indifferent; if it fails, however, give the party only one more chance to successfully reach a détente.","The PCs may also try to bluff their way past the orcs by making a Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check with disadvantage (no disadvantage if they've been talked into indifference), opposed by the orcs' Intelligence or Wisdom, depending on the nature of the bluff.

If the orcs' adjusted experience points would make them a Deadly encounter for the party, consider them stronger; otherwise, consider them weaker.) If the PC succeeds on their {@skill Intimidation} check and the orcs fail their Wisdom check, the orcs are rattled, their attitude shifts to indifferent, and the PC gets advantage on their next social skill check with the orcs.

From this point on, it's a slugfest. As long as the orcs aren't seriously injured, they keep fighting, using their Greataxe action every round and moving on to the next PC back if they hew down one in the front line. If there's a PC between 30 and 60 feet past the one the orc has just felled, it has a chance to use Aggressive again—so why not? This should create a moment of excitement in your session and put a healthy fear of orcs into your archers and spellslingers.","Despite their aggression and stupidity, even orcs know when they're overmatched. Depending on how you, the DM, believe that this particular group of orcs should act, a seriously injured orc (reduced to 6 hp or fewer) may be willing to fight to the death for honor's sake, or it may possess more of a will to survive, in which case it will {@action Disengage} and retreat its full movement distance. (My own inclination is to have orcs that see their fellows retreating successfully be more willing to retreat themselves, while orcs whose fellows have been slain will fight to the death themselves.) An orc that finds itself fighting two or more foes rather than just one tries to reposition itself so that it has to fight only one, if possible. Since this will always involve moving out of at least one opponent's reach, there are three possible ways: {@action Dodge}, then reposition; {@action Disengage}, then reposition; or reposition, risking an opportunity strike, then attack. The first two, frankly, strike me as un-orc-like, while the third strikes me as very orc-like. If there's no way for the orc to evade its extra attackers without their simply closing with it again, then {@action Disengage}/retreat seems like the most likely response—either that or, if its fellows have been slain, fiercely fighting to the death.","The fact that a group of orcs has retreated doesn't mean combat is over. The survivors long for payback. Orcs aren't stealthy, so they won't stalk the characters, but they'll certainly keep an eye out for the PCs as long as they're in that vicinity. If they re-encounter the PCs, and if the PCs seem to be weakened in any way, the orcs will seize the moment and attack—once again, using Aggressive to charge in and strike the first blows."]},{"type":"entries","name":"{@creature Orog|TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing}","page":35,"entries":["The Monster Manual lists several orc variants that may appear in encounters with intermediate-level PCs. The orog is a much stronger, tougher, and smarter variant with many more hit points and two swings per Multiattack action. Ordinary orcs aren't smart enough to strategize, but orogs are. A group of orcs that includes one or more orogs and that knows the PCs are in the area doesn't go after them right away but rather waits until nightfall, to take advantage of the orcs' {@sense darkvision}: In darkness, PCs who lack {@sense darkvision} are effectively {@condition blinded} and make attack rolls with disadvantage, while the orcs have advantage on their own attack rolls. Orogs also have the sense to {@action Disengage} before repositioning in melee combat and may even order regular orcs to do the same. However, their Wisdom is no higher than that of a regular orc, so they're {@condition prone} to the same \"death before dishonor\" attitude when they're low on hit points."]},{"type":"entries","name":"{@creature Orc War Chief|TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing}","page":35,"entries":["An orc war chief is a formidable opponent, even more so than an orog. It possesses the orog's Strength and Constitution, a high Charisma, less Intelligence than an orog but more than an average orc, Multiattack ability, and proficiency bonuses on several types of saving throws, plus two fearsome features: Gruumsh's Fury and Battle Cry.","Gruumsh's Fury is a passive trait that increases the orc war chief's weapon damage by {@dice 1d8} on every hit. This doesn't affect its tactics at all; it simply makes the orc war chief a wickedly effective damage dealer. The real game-changer is Battle Cry, a once-per-day power that gives the orc war chief's warriors advantage on attack rolls for the next turn. The effectiveness of Battle Cry is maximized when it can buff the greatest number of orcs. Therefore, there's no reason at all for the orc war chief to wait to use it, save one: The war chief has to forgo its own attack to use it, because Battle Cry is an action. The cost/benefit analysis hinges on which is expected to do more damage: a horde of orcs with advantage or a single orc war chief swinging its greataxe.","By itself, an orc war chief, with +6 to hit, has a 70 percent chance to hit an AC 13 opponent. It does an average of 15 damage with every hit, and it gets two swings per Multiattack action. Therefore, its expected damage per round is 21. A regular orc, with +5 to hit, has a 65 percent chance to hit an AC 13 opponent; it does an average of 10 damage with every hit, and it gets only one chance per round. Ordinarily, therefore, its expected damage per round is 6. If the orc attacks with advantage, however, its chance to hit increases from 65 percent to 88 percent, so its expected damage increases to 8. In short, giving a single orc advantage on its attack roll increases its expected damage by about 2 (2.1, to be exact). From this, we can determine that the orc war chief will prefer to use Battle Cry rather than charge with its troops and Multiattack when it commands a force of no fewer than ten ordinary orcs.","Would an orc war chief have any way to calculate this? No. But it would know intuitively, from its battlefield experience (which comes mostly from fighting other orcs, who have AC 13—that's why I chose that number), that issuing a Battle Cry before charging seems to make a difference in a group of ten or more orc warriors, while in a smaller group, it doesn't.","All that being said, the Battle Cry action also allows the orc war chief to make a single attack as a bonus action, meaning that if it's already next to an enemy, it's giving up only one of its two potential attacks. So if the war chief is fighting alongside five or more other orcs, but fewer than ten, it still uses Battle Cry—after it's already charged with the rest of its band."]},{"type":"entries","name":"{@creature Orc Eye of Gruumsh|TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing}","page":37,"entries":["Last, there's the orc Eye of Gruumsh, a battlefield cleric. Smarter and wiser than an ordinary orc but not any stronger or tougher, the Eye of Gruumsh is distinguished most by its spellcasting ability. (It also has Gruumsh's Fury, but again, this is a passive trait whose only function is to increase weapon damage—although this makes more of a difference for the Eye of Gruumsh than for the war chief, because the Eye of Gruumsh uses only a spear, not a greataxe.) The variety of spells at its disposal potentially makes the Eye of Gruumsh's combat strategy much more complex, so we need to take a look at the effects and effectiveness of each spell and how it fits into the Eye of Gruumsh's action economy.","One spell stands out: spiritual weapon. Unlike all the Eye of Gruumsh's other spells, this one is cast as a bonus action and, in addition, gives the caster a new bonus action to use every round. This completely changes the Eye of Gruumsh's action economy. The Eye of Gruumsh still charges with all the other orcs, because otherwise, its Aggressive trait would be wasted. But on its second combat round it casts spiritual weapon as a bonus action, and on every subsequent round (up to the spell's 1-minute duration) it continues to use its bonus action, again and again, to attack tougher or harder-to-reach opponents with the Floating Spear of Glowy Force.","The question now is, what does the Eye of Gruumsh do with its action? Spiritual weapon won't require {@status concentration}, so it can start the battle off with a spell that does: bless, guidance, or resistance, of which bless is clearly the strongest. (Which of its companions would the Eye of Gruumsh bless? Orcs aren't exactly altruistic. I'd say it would first take a blessing for itself, then give one to the orc war chief, if there is one, then to any other individual that stands out in the group.)","How about once combat is underway? Augury takes a full minute to cast and has no purpose in combat. Thaumaturgy is interesting, but one has to consider its primary application to be during the parley phase, when the orcs are trying to maximize their fearsomeness. That leaves command.","Command can have a tide-of-battle-swinging effect. One possible beneficial outcome of command is that a PC may be forced into a position that gives opponents advantage on melee attacks. Another is that a PC, ordered to flee, may be subjected to one or more opportunity attacks.","Let's look at what the Eye of Gruumsh gives up by doing this: its Spear action. Against AC 13 (what most orcs are used to, as mentioned above), with +5 to hit, the Eye of Gruumsh has a 65 percent chance of dealing an average of 11 damage, for an expected damage per round of 7. For the Eye of Gruumsh to forgo its Spear action in favor of casting command, the effect of the spell needs to inflict at least 8 expected damage.","As we saw previously, giving an ordinary orc advantage on an attack roll increases its expected damage by about 2. That's not enough for the Eye of Gruumsh to give up its own Spear action. What about an orog? Still not enough: The damage increase is about the same, although it is doubled because of the orog's Multiattack. An orc war chief? Now it starts to get interesting, because the war chief does so much damage with each hit. But the increase in expected damage from attacking with advantage turns out to be surprisingly small: only about 3 per attack, or 6 altogether. And, of course, the Eye of Gruumsh doesn't itself benefit from ordering a foe to grovel, because it gives up one attack action to gain advantage on the next, allowing it one hit at most, rather than two. In addition, we have to remember that the target of a command gets to make a saving throw, so all these gains are attenuated by the probability that the target will shrug it off.","However, what if the Eye of Gruumsh can provoke multiple opportunity attacks on an enemy by ordering them to flee? For starters, opportunity attacks are reactions, meaning we're adding a new element to the action economy. Also, this isn't about the difference between attacking with advantage and attacking without it—it's about the difference between getting an attack and not getting an attack. One orc's expected damage per attack is 6—not as much as the Eye of Gruumsh's expected damage per attack—but two orcs' expected damage is double that, and three orcs' expected damage is triple that, and so on. An orog's expected damage per attack is 7, and an orc war chief's is 10. Command's chance of success is only fifty-fifty even against an average person, so we have to figure that there need to be several orcs on hand to make opportunity attacks for this stunt to be worth trying.","Here's our conclusion: An orc Eye of Gruumsh forgoes its own Spear action in order to cast command against a foe that's within reach of four or more ordinary orcs, or two or more plus a leader. It issues the command \"Scram!\" (equivalent to Flee) in order to provoke an opportunity attack from every orc that can reach the target."]}]},{"type":"entries","name":"Gnolls","page":39,"entries":[{"type":"entries","name":"{@creature Gnoll|TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing}","page":39,"entries":["Gnolls are described in the Monster Manual as rapacious raiders, scavengers, and nomads with hyena-like heads. They have high Strength and low Intelligence; their behavior is driven by their violent and destructive instincts. Like many other humanoid D&D monsters, they have {@sense darkvision}. They wield spears and longbows, according to the Monster Manual, and they have one distinguishing feature, Rampage, which allows them to move half their speed and make a bonus bite attack after reducing a foe to 0 hp in melee.","Honestly, I'd dispense with the longbow—it doesn't make sense in the context of what else the Monster Manual says about gnolls. Their Strength is high enough that they gain little advantage from using one. They aren't smart enough to craft one or social enough to barter for one. According to the flavor text, gnolls prefer to strike at easy targets; longbows are designed to puncture armor. And gnolls' single unique feature is melee-oriented.","So my vision of the gnoll is strictly a hand-to-hand fighter. As creatures with high Strength, high-average Dexterity, average Constitution, and a respectable five hit dice, gnolls are shock troops. When they spot a vulnerable target, most likely during a nighttime patrol ({@sense darkvision} provides advantage on attack rolls against PCs who don't have it), they strike at once. They're fearless and aggressive, using their full movement speed to approach their targets, then attacking with spears; if one such attack reduces an enemy to 0 hp, the gnoll Rampages toward another enemy within 15 feet and bites it (bonus action).","As vicious as they are, however, gnolls are creatures of instinct without ideology, and they place their own survival over such concepts as valor or honor. If one is seriously wounded (reduced to 8 hp or fewer), it turns tail and flees, using the {@action Dash} action to get away as fast as possible and potentially exposing itself to one or more opportunity attacks in the process."]},{"type":"entries","name":"{@creature Gnoll Pack Lord|TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing}","page":40,"entries":["A pack of gnolls may be led by a gnoll pack lord, which is a more able specimen in every respect, including getting two swings per Multiattack action and having the Incite Rampage feature. (It also wields a glaive, which I have to imagine—given that even the gnoll pack lord's Intelligence is only 8—consists of a pillaged sword lashed to the end of a spear. By gnoll standards, this surely qualifies as technological genius.)","Incite Rampage is part of the gnoll pack lord's Multiattack combo, so the gnoll pack lord doesn't have to forgo attacking to use it. Effectively, what Incite Rampage does is grant another gnoll in the pack (a technicality in the wording of Incite Rampage restricts its application to other gnolls, plus giant hyenas, since these are the only creatures with Rampage) the equivalent of an immediate opportunity attack against its opponent. This happens during the gnoll pack lord's action. Incite Rampage consumes that gnoll's reaction, so if its opponent moves out of its reach, it can't make an actual opportunity attack.","Aside from this feature, the only other distinctive thing about the gnoll pack lord is the fact that its \"glaive\" (snicker) gives it 10 feet of reach rather than 5 feet.

Gnolls sense weakness and zero in on it, so assume that the Fang of Yeenoghu can \"read\" a PC's hit points and Armor Class and strike accordingly. This also allows the Fang of Yeenoghu to maximize the value of its Rampage feature, because by targeting PCs with fewer hit points first, it increases its chances of getting to Rampage more than once. If you're a tenderhearted DM who wants to protect the fragile flowers in your players' party, don't throw a Fang of Yeenoghu at them, because that thing's gotta follow its nature.","One other detail about the gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu, which has nothing to do with its tactics but is still worth noting: Unlike gnolls and gnoll pack lords, the Fang of Yeenoghu isn't categorized as a humanoid. It's a fiend, and as such it's detectable by a paladin's Divine Sense or a ranger's Primeval Awareness, and a protection from evil and good spell offers defense against it."]}]},{"type":"entries","name":"Lizardfolk","page":41,"entries":[{"type":"entries","name":"{@creature Lizardfolk|TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing}","page":41,"entries":["Lizardfolk aren't sophisticated, but they are significantly tougher than goblins, kobolds, and orcs. According to the Monster Manual flavor text, their most salient behavioral trait is their territoriality, followed by their generally acting like South Seas cannibals in a movie from the 1940s. On the flip side, the text does acknowledge that lizardfolk may occasionally form alliances with outsiders, but we'll set that aside, since it's not going to influence their combat tactics.","Lizardfolk, like orcs, are brutes: average Dexterity, high Strength and Constitution. They're also proficient in {@skill Perception} and {@skill Stealth}, and they're more or less amphibious—they can't breathe underwater, but they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes, and they can swim as fast as they can move on land.","Based on this information, the most likely lizardfolk encounter scenario is with a group of scouts patrolling the outskirts of their territory. They'll be alert to intruders—it's why they're out there. Once they notice intruders, they start stalking them (from cover to cover if on land, underwater if in a swamp), until they're close enough to attack. Then they strike first, with surprise if possible.","The lizardfolk's Multiattack action specifies, \"The lizardfolk makes two melee attacks, each one with a different weapon.\" The choices available are Bite, Heavy Club, Javelin, and Spiked Shield. Honestly, the only combinations of these that don't strike me as silly are Heavy Club/Spiked Shield and Javelin/Spiked Shield. The lizardfolk's upright physiology makes the idea of their lunging to bite absurd, let alone lunging to bite in combination with swinging or thrusting a melee weapon. Of course, it's all cosmetic, since every one of the lizardfolk's attacks has the same attack modifier and deals the same damage; the only difference is whether the damage done is bludgeoning (the club) or piercing (everything else), and even that isn't a real difference unless a PC is covered by a magic item or spell that provides resistance to one type of damage and not the other. Let's just say that a lizardfolk's Multiattack action consists of one weapon strike and one shield bash and leave it at that.","Lizardfolk don't have any feature that grants them bonus actions or unique reactions, and their Intelligence is low, so we can assume that they fight like primitives: They pick an enemy, they bash that enemy, and they keep going until the enemy is dead or they're seriously wounded themselves (reduced to 8 hp or fewer). At that point, whether they keep fighting depends entirely on whether or not they're within their own territory. If they are, they keep fighting to the death.","If they're not—if they were scouting beyond their borders, or if they were on a raid—they {@action Dash} back toward their own territory as fast as they can, potentially incurring one or more opportunity attacks. Instinctively, they always attack from the direction of their own territory and position themselves with their backs toward it. They may ambush, but they don't flank.","Long-range weapon attacks confuse them, and magic awes and terrifies them. A lizardfolk shot by an arrow or crossbow bolt instinctively moves in the direction of its territory. (If it's already within its territory, it moves toward the center of that territory.) Depending on the type of spell, the damage it does, whether the lizardfolk can see the caster, and whether they can get to them, they either try to rush the caster or run for their lives. Rushing is more likely if they can see the caster, the spell does no more than light damage (5 or less), and/or there's no other PC in the way. Running is more likely if they can't tell where the spell came from, the spell does serious damage (14 or more), and/or there are too many enemies between themselves and the caster.","Lizardfolk never surrender voluntarily: They assume that they'll be killed. However, lizardfolk who are subdued and captured are impassive about it and will talk to their captors, if any of them speaks Draconic, without sullenness or bluster. That being said, they'll also turn against their captors in a heartbeat if their chances of success look good.

After that, the shaman doesn't enter melee combat—not that it couldn't, being just as strong and tough as any other lizardfolk, but unlike them, it's smart enough to know that if it took a solid hit, its {@status concentration} could be broken, and then there'd go the cobras. Instead, the shaman lobs produce flame cantrips (which do {@damage 2d8} fire damage rather than {@dice 1d8}, because the shaman is a level 5 spellcaster) at any enemies within 30 feet. Its fellow lizardfolk, incidentally, aren't afraid of this magic—on the contrary, since the shaman is on their side, they're feeling extra bold and are much more likely to rush an enemy caster rather than run from them. They'll also become mighty salty if anyone dares to assault their shaman.","Speaking of enemy casters, if one makes the mistake of coming within 30 feet of the lizardfolk shaman, it casts thorn whip and yanks them forward, so that the other lizardfolk can pound them into jelly.","What if the shaman is targeted by a ranged attacker? It's still caught off guard, but its greater mental flexibility allows it to come up with a purposeful response.","If its {@status concentration} isn't broken, it sends a couple of the king cobras (or whatever creatures it summoned) after the PC who shot it. If its {@status concentration} is broken, its main contribution to the battle has just been negated, and until it takes care of that marksman, there's not a lot more that it can do: Most of its spells don't have great range. But since its fellow lizardfolk are useless against ranged attackers, the shaman has to take care of the problem itself. In a swamp, it can Change Shape into crocodile form, submerge, and go after the shooter. In jungle, this won't work, because a crocodile has only 20 feet of movement speed over land, so a marksman can easily keep their distance. The shaman will be forced to conclude that the battle is going south and cast fog cloud, either to cover the lizardfolk's escape (if they're outside their territory) or to enshroud the PCs so that the lizardfolk can reposition themselves more advantageously.","In general, any time a battle outside their territory goes badly for the lizardfolk—say, at least half of them seriously wounded—the lizardfolk shaman casts fog cloud to help them get away. (Inside their territory, the shaman will have already cast fog cloud on the PCs first, to allow the lizardfolk warriors to sneak up on them quickly.) If the fog cloud is dispelled (by gust of wind, say) while the lizardfolk are retreating, the shaman will follow up with plant growth to slow their pursuers even further. (What about entangle and spike growth? Their utility diminishes significantly in a swamp or jungle, where the terrain is already difficult. And the fact that they also require {@status concentration} forces a choice between one of them and conjure animals or fog cloud, which are clearly superior.)"]},{"type":"entries","name":"{@creature Lizard King|TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing|Lizard King/Queen}","page":45,"entries":["The lizard king/queen isn't complicated at all.

Along with suggestion, they can cast the cantrip poison spray three times per day at its base damage level of {@dice 1d12} (I like to imagine that they spit it from their mouths). They can also cast animal friendship on snakes, for whatever that's worth.","According to the Monster Manual flavor text, yuan-ti purebloods often put on cloaks and try to pass for human in order to \"kidnap prisoners for interrogation and sacrifice,\" so let's start with that: The yuan-ti wants to kill you, but it doesn't want to kill you right here and now. Instead, it wants to get you someplace where it can kill you in a way that makes its gods happy.","Therefore, a yuan-ti pureblood encounter is going to begin with the yuan-ti cloaked and hooded, using {@skill Deception} to hide what they are, and casting suggestion as soon as the player characters approach within 30 feet, saying something along the lines of \"This is a dangerous place, and you look like you could use some extra help. Come with us.\" I'd say that their moderately high Intelligence combined with the fact that this is an innate ability lets them \"read\" the PCs to pick out which ones have the lowest Wisdom saving throws and therefore will be most susceptible.

I know which one I'd choose. Changing into snake form offers the yuan-ti malison no combat advantage at all, except—implicitly—immunity to the {@condition prone} condition (the stat block doesn't say this explicitly, but think about it for a second), and it comes with the disadvantage of divesting it of its weapons. I'd say this is a dubiously useful ability at best, and I wouldn't have a yuan-ti malison Shapechange during combat, except maybe to escape through a tiny hole.","One of the things I like about the type 3 yuan-ti malison is that it has the extra attacking feature Constrict, which does {@damage 2d6 + 3} bludgeoning damage and grapples its target, restraining it as well.

They have the same Constrict ability as the type 3 malison and can combine it with melee attacks in the same way. They have spectacular ability scores across the board, but their Strength of 19 stands out. A yuan-ti abomination is a great boss enemy for a party of intermediate-level PCs.","Yuan-ti abominations have mostly the same toolkit as malisons, with one cherry on top: the ability to cast fear once per day. Why would they cast that, though? They're havoc in battle: Once they grapple an enemy, they can take three scimitar swings with advantage and +7 to hit. (That's an 88 percent chance to hit against AC 15.) Whether they're attacking at range with longbows or in melee with scimitars, they do nearly double the malison's damage.","There are only two reasons why a yuan-ti abomination would opt for fear over simply beating the tar out of its opponents: Either it's protecting some kind of sacred or otherwise important place, and keeping trespassers away is its foremost priority; or its opponents are tougher than it bargained for, and it's losing the fight.","In the former case—that is, when the yuan-ti abomination is more interested in driving the PCs away than in murdering them—it casts fear at the very beginning of the encounter, then fights those too stubborn to go away. In the latter case, it casts fear when it's moderately injured (reduced to 88 hp or fewer), in order to reduce the number of enemies that it and its allies have to deal with right away, and if it's seriously injured (reduced to 50 hp or fewer), it Disengages and attempts to retreat.","A yuan-ti abomination fighting to protect a place of importance does so fanatically. If it's seriously injured in that scenario, it won't retreat but rather will fight to the death. If it's accompanied by yuan-ti malisons and purebloods, and if they're in a settlement or other location where reinforcements may be available, one or more of the yuan-ti abomination's allies will break off when the abomination is moderately injured and run/slither to fetch more.","Yuan-ti abominations are very intelligent. They issue commands to their allies, telling them what locations to attack or defend and which enemies to prioritize. Because all yuan-ti are magic-resistant, they don't place the same emphasis on spellcasters that other intelligent enemies might. Instead, they focus on strong and tough PCs, double- or triple-teaming them, and on particularly effective ranged fighters. They may single out PC clerics and paladins as well, simply out of sectarian loathing. Also, they direct their allies to make use of choke points, high ground, and other strategically useful terrain.","Finally, yuan-ti abominations monologue as they fight, because what more could you want from a fanatically religious enemy boss with Charisma 18?

The Monster Manual flavor text describes them as \"struck with a deep inferiority complex... desperately crav[ing] the fear and respect of outsiders\" and says they'll generally prefer to capture trespassers rather than kill them outright, hauling them back to win favor with their rulers first. One way they do this is by taming giant frogs and having them swallow victims whole; however, this works only on Small or Tiny targets, meaning that unless a party of PCs is made up entirely of halflings and gnomes, this isn't a strategy they can rely on in a typical encounter.","For creatures with only two hit dice, bullywugs aren't too shabby in combat. All their physical abilities are modestly above average, and they have proficiency in {@skill Stealth} and the Swamp Camouflage trait, which grants them advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks in swampy terrain. It's fair to say, therefore, that bullywugs won't venture outside such areas—not when they have such a natural advantage on their home turf.","Moreover, their Standing Leap ability lets them move their full speed of 20 feet per turn as a long jump, when the jumping rule would normally allow them to leap only 6 feet. This allows them to cover distance in difficult marshy terrain without having to halve their movement speed. If you want to be nitpicky about it, you can require them to succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check when they land, per \"Special Types of Movement: Jumping\" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook, but personally, I'd say that bullywugs, whose natural habitat is the swamp, shouldn't have to make that check when landing. And for the sake of flavor, I like the idea of having bullywugs bouncing around like a bunch of ornery little Superballs during combat rather than trudging around in 2-D as we landbound humanoids must. (Mind you, this doesn't exempt them from opportunity attacks when they jump out of PCs' reach.)","Okay, so far we've established that bullywug encounters will occur in swamps. Let's also stipulate, based on the aforementioned features, that their favored strategy is ambush (their physical abilities don't indicate a preference for one form of combat over another, but their features do). Now let's add, based on their 40- foot swimming speed, that they prefer combat to take place near open water: This is their favored method of escape. From the bullywugs' point of view, the ideal ambush location is on ground solid enough to fight on but also near water deep enough to swim in. They're Medium creatures, so this depth will be at least 3 feet.","Wanting, ideally, to capture rather than kill, bullywugs attack in numbers large enough to surround and overwhelm a party of adventurers—let's say three to one. But here's a question: If you can get a free attack by popping out of hiding and surprising your enemies, will you really forgo that attack and demand their surrender when it costs you the benefit of surprise if they decide to fight back? Bullywugs aren't bright, but I think even they can grasp what the whole point of an ambush is. They'll take that surprise attack, thank you, and with any luck, the damage they do in the first round will serve as further incentive to stand down. If that damage should happen, by some fluke, to knock a target out, they'll make it nonlethal.","So here's what round 1 looks like: The bullywugs lie in wait, hidden, at a range of 15 to 20 feet from where they expect the PCs to pass. At the right moment, they spring out of hiding, land next to the PCs, and kick off melee combat with surprise, spearing and biting. In round 2, they keep attacking while demanding the PCs' surrender—in Bullywug, because they're too dumb to realize that the PCs don't speak Bullywug. In round 3, they also keep attacking and demanding the PCs' surrender, still in Bullywug but louder and more slowly. If any PC gets the message and drops their weapon, the nearest bullywug will grab and grapple that PC and pull them away from the fight, rifling through their pockets and pouches for anything valuable.","Bullywugs are cowards. If one is moderately wounded (reduced to 7 hp or fewer), it will leap away, but it won't flee just yet—it will look for an opportunity to get back in the fight alongside a couple of less wounded allies, and in the meantime, it Hides and repositions. However, a seriously injured bullywug (reduced to 4 hp or fewer) will indeed flee, using the {@action Dash} action to double its movement speed, leaping into the nearest water deep enough to swim in (and possibly incurring one or more opportunity attacks), then swimming away. If no water of sufficient depth is near enough, it simply leaps twice, 20 feet each time. Bullywugs also flee when their numbers are reduced to fewer than one-and-a-half the number of PCs, then attempt to regroup with other bullywugs in the area, stalk the PCs, and attack again when the opportunity presents itself."]}]},{"type":"entries","name":"Kuo-toa","page":51,"entries":["Old-school D&D players will recall that the kuo-toa made their debut in the venerated, if somewhat incoherent, D series of adventure modules, which also introduced the drow.

In fifth edition, however, the kuo-toa have been retconned into broken ex-subjects of an empire of mind flayers, their rivalry with the drow now mentioned only in passing.","\"Many weapons of the kuo-toa are designed to capture rather than kill,\" the Monster Manual flavor text informs us, but it leaves open the question of what they want to capture anyone for. Religious sacrifice, maybe? Interrogation? Enslavement? Found-art pieces?

This is tricky to interpret. Ambush isn't a realistic possibility, but neither is protracted toe-to-toe fighting. Kuo-toa need to be selective about their encounters and maneuver their foes into situations where they're {@condition restrained} and helpless.","They do this primarily by using nets. A Net attack restrains an opponent, giving the kuo-toa advantage on attack rolls and giving the opponent disadvantage. However, because of their extremely short range, solo Net attacks always have disadvantage. Also, the net is effortless to escape from, so there need to be a second, third, and fourth kuo-toa on hand to throw more nets, ensuring a reasonable chance that a target will be trapped under at least two. Since a target can escape from only one net at a time, this guarantees that they'll remain {@condition restrained}.","What this tells us is that kuo-toa don't attack without a four-to-one numerical advantage or better, throwing nets until a target is covered by two, then attacking with advantage using the Spear action. If you're using the optional Flanking rule (Dungeon Master's Guide, chapter 8), you can get away with a two-to-one advantage: Once the target is under a single net, the battle buddies quickly get on either side of them in order to maintain their advantage in case the captive wriggles free, then begin stabbing.","Kuo-toa can breathe underwater, from which we can infer another possible tactic: hauling enemies into the water and trying to drown them. Assuming that the kuo-toa double-team their foes, one grappling and the other taking the {@action Help} action to confer advantage on the check, the grapple-and-drown tactic is reasonable against opponents whose Strength ({@skill Athletics}) and Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) modifiers are both +4 or lower; to have any real confidence of success, they both need to be +1 or lower. If there are more kuo-toa on hand, they can throw nets before grappling; this doesn't impose disadvantage on rolls to escape a grapple, but it overwhelms the target, giving them too many things they have to escape from. Once a target is both {@condition restrained} and {@condition grappled}, any remaining kuo-toa stab.","Kuo-toa can't read PCs' stats. They can only know from experience whether a tactic generally works or generally doesn't, and what experience tells them is that it's possible for two of them to drown one average or punier-than-average humanoid, but against a big or brawny one, it doesn't usually work.","The Sticky Shield reaction gives the kuo-toa a chance to disable an opponent's weapon. It's only usable in melee. Therefore, kuo-toa prefer melee over ranged combat and close to melee range as soon as they've thrown their nets. (The Monster Manual indicates that monsters with throwable weapons can be assumed to carry {@dice 2d4} of them, but nets are big and bulky. I wouldn't give a single kuo-toa more than one.)","If nets and grappling clearly aren't getting the desired result but the kuo-toa still outnumber their opponents at least three to one, they'll switch to attacking with Spear alone, to maximize damage. This is the full extent of their ability to adapt. If they no longer have the numbers, they {@action Dash} away (through water, if possible).

Its pincer staff grapples opponents on a melee hit, not on a skill contest, and its escape DC makes it comparable to two regular kuo-toa working together, making it possible to execute the grapple-and-drown tactic with fewer attackers. The execution of this tactic depends on which has higher initiative, the whip or its kuo-toa allies. If the kuo-toa allies go first, they throw their nets, and then the kuotoa whip Multiattacks, gaining advantage on its staff attack rolls if any nets landed. If the whip goes first, it Readies a Pincer Staff attack, the triggering condition being when a kuo-toa ally makes a Net attack; in this case, it doesn't get to Multiattack, because its attack is now a reaction.","Shield of faith is a bonus action but also a {@status concentration}-required spell with just one target. Bane requires {@status concentration} as well, affecting up to three creatures but also costing a full action.

This is where their habitations are and where they're most likely to be encountered. With a 40-foot swimming speed and only a 10-foot land speed, getting into a scrap on dry land is a very bad proposition for merfolk. Underwater, their swimming speed is a huge advantage against any creature not native to the depths.","Although their ability scores all fall into a typical humanoid range, they do have above-average Dexterity and Constitution, and these, combined with their swimming speed, bias them toward a skirmish style of combat. Since the spears they carry can be thrown underwater at normal range without disadvantage, part of a group of merfolk can engage in melee while others throw their spears; some may even do both.","It's worth a closer examination to see just how big an advantage their swimming speed is for them. For a character who isn't innately aquatic or buffed by a magic item, every foot swum costs an extra foot of movement, effectively halving movement speed in most cases. This means that Silvio the Swordsman is slowed to 15 feet per round underwater, whereas his merfolk opponent can swim 40 feet per round.","How do they use this to gain an even greater advantage? Mainly, by goading opponents into splitting up. Rather than coalesce around a melee front line, merfolk initiate combat by throwing spears from a distance of exactly 20 feet—no more, no less—from all sides of their foes, if possible. If they're on defense and can attack from only one side, they form a line, from which the ones on the ends spread out while the ones in the center fall back, eventually forming a semicircle around their opponents. (Because underwater combat takes place in three dimensions, some can also go up or down.)","As they encircle (or en-semicircle, or en-hemisphere) their enemies, they fall back as those enemies advance, maintaining that 20-foot distance. If an enemy does manage to close the distance with a merfolk, it stops throwing spears and starts stabbing with one instead; ditto if the merfolk have managed to lure their foes into spreading out 30 feet or more from one another, or if the withdrawing merfolk is down to its last spear. It's only practical to carry so many spears—three or four is probably the limit—and a merfolk never throws its last one.

If reinforcements are available, it then Dashes off to fetch them.","Against a party of low-level adventurers, {@footnote as many as five merfolk to one PC constitute a winnable fight (although two to one is fairer for novice adventurers just starting out)|According to \"Creating a Combat Encounter\" in chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, these merfolk-to-PC ratios constitute Deadly encounters.

I ran a test scenario comprising ten merfolk against five level 1 PCs with water breathing cast upon them, which ended in the merfolk's being routed with only two PCs wounded. I conclude that Xanathar's is right.}, so there should always be plenty of merfolk on hand to allow some to fight hand-to-hand, some to throw spears, and some to retreat.","Merfolk are neutral, not evil, which means their initial disposition toward strangers is indifference rather than hostility. They are cautious, however, and order any strangers who approach to between 20 and 60 feet to halt and state their business. If they're not satisfied by the reply they receive (they don't take \"Blurrrbbblllpp!\" for an answer), they cock their spears as a warning.

Those ocean trenches are as far from the coasts as the highest mountains are, and you don't often hear about the yetis of the Himalayas spending an afternoon staging a raid on Kolkata, or the Tatzelwürmer of the Alps popping down to Genoa for some late-night ravaging. These are distances of hundreds of miles we're talking about. So chances are, any sahuagin that PCs encounter are going to be denizens of shallower depths. Maybe they're the border reivers of the ocean kingdom.","When they come ashore to raid, they do so at night, as implied by their 120 feet of {@sense darkvision} (which also helps them see deep underwater).

Unlike, say, merrows, sahuagin can move about on land as easily as any other humanoid.","In this environment, they're basic brutes. Their Multiattack gives them one Spear or Claw attack and one Bite attack. Since their Armor Class doesn't include a shield, we can presume that they wield their spears two-handed for the greater damage.","Because their Blood Frenzy trait gives them advantage on attacks against any opponent who's taken damage already, they'll press this advantage, continuing to attack any enemy they've bloodied rather than switch targets, even for opportunistic reasons.","However, sahuagin are not dumb. In fact, their Intelligence and Wisdom are higher than those of the average humanoid. They attack with discipline, in cohesive units, perhaps even splitting up to flank or encircle a group of enemies.","They'll realize quickly when they're outmatched, retreating if all the members of their fighting group are moderately wounded (reduced to 15 hp or fewer) and their enemies aren't hurt even worse.

Once they see a player character cast a spell, they'll draw the logical (though not necessarily correct) conclusion that that same PC is the one enabling their allies to breathe, and they'll focus their attacks on that PC. If they subsequently see a different PC cast a spell, some of them will break off to attack them as well. (They may or may not be aware that water breathing isn't a spell that requires {@status concentration}. If they are aware of this, they'll fixate less on hunting spellcasters, since they'll know that killing the caster won't break the spell.)","Sahuagin in the water are also more tenacious than sahuagin on land.

If the priestess's allies are focusing attacks on a spellcaster, the priestess casts guiding bolt at that caster to do some radiant damage and also give advantage to the next attacker. If it's clear that the players' ability to breathe water doesn't come from a sustained spell, the priestess casts hold person on the most dangerous looking opponent who has the Extra Attack feature. If there are two, and the priestess can't choose between them, she spends a 3rd-level slot to boost the hold person spell and nab them both. However, that being said, sahuagin priestesses understand the connection between clerical spellcasting and the brandishing of holy symbols, and they also know that spells like hold person don't work as well on the devout, so paladins get a free pass from this.","The presence of a priestess also keeps a moderately wounded group of sahuagin in the fight longer: Anytime all the sahuagin in the group are reduced to 15 hp or fewer, the priestess casts mass healing word to top them back up, then uses either the {@action Help} action or the {@action Dodge} action, as in round 1, until all her 3rd-level spell slots are gone.","Finally, in any group of sahuagin with both a baron and a priestess, it's the priestess, not the baron, that's the de facto leader (whether or not the baron cares to admit it).

With their expertise in {@skill Perception}, they make great scouts, and when fighting alongside PCs, they'll volunteer to act as scouts and strike at enemies who are attempting to hide.","Aarakocra strategy revolves around two things: getting the best use out of their Dive Attack and staying out of reach until they're ready to strike. Thus, if they observe that their enemies have missile or throwable weapons, they keep to an altitude just out of those weapons' normal range until they're close enough to dive; they also use tree canopies as cover, where available, since it's the only cover they're likely to be able to take advantage of. While scouting, they use the {@action Search} action if their passive {@skill Perception} isn't high enough to spot a target, then switch to {@action Dodge} once they've found one and are closing in. Against enemies without ranged attack capability, they maintain a cruising altitude of 30 feet while Searching and Dodging; against other fliers, it's a dance in which the Dodging aarakocra try to goad their foes into approaching to a distance of 30 to 50 feet.","That range is the sweet spot for a Dive Attack, against either a ground-bound or an aerial enemy. (Reduce the upper bound a bit for aarakocra diving through a tree canopy, which must constitute difficult terrain for a flying creature.) As soon as an aarakocra can reach an enemy in a single round's flying movement, it dives and strikes, gaining an extra damage die thanks to Dive Attack. The Javelin action is preferred over the Talon action, just because the average damage is slightly better.","What happens next depends on the kind of society your aarakocra belong to.

If so, then after striking once with Dive Attack, their next action will be to {@action Disengage} and fly back up into the air, setting up for another Dive Attack on the following turn.

Without Flyby or an equivalent trait, trying to get airborne again for another Dive Attack would invite an opportunity strike, and their Armor Class and hit points aren't good enough for them to risk that.","Aarakocra attacking foes that lack ranged attacks, or that wield only throwable weapons, slings, hand crossbows, or other missiles with very short range, may spend one or more rounds flying down to a height of 30 feet, throwing a javelin, then flying back up out of reach again until their foes are seriously wounded (reduced to 40 percent or less of their hit point maximum). At this point they finally use their Dive Attack to try to finish their enemies off. Both trained and untrained aarakocra may employ this tactic, which deals slightly more damage, on average, than making Dive Attacks on alternate turns—although it's limited by the number of javelins the aarakocra carry. An aarakocra never throws its last javelin unless it's retreating.","In short, against enemies with good ranged attacks, aarakocra emphasize melee fighting, and against enemies without good ranged attacks, aarakocra emphasize ranged attacks of their own. They Dive Attack to avoid incoming missiles, against seriously injured enemies, or when they're down to their last javelin. Otherwise, they do their best to stay out of reach.","Untrained aarakocra retreat from melee, using just their normal flying movement, when they're moderately wounded (reduced to 9 hp or fewer), but they'll continue throwing javelins, if it makes sense to do so, until they're seriously wounded (reduced to 5 hp or fewer). Trained aarakocra continue fighting until they're seriously wounded, then fly off to a safe distance as fast as they can. If they're engaged in melee, they {@action Disengage}; otherwise, they {@action Dash}.","Aarakocra fighting alongside PCs coordinate their attacks with whatever the PCs are doing, in a limited fashion.

In combination with its proficiency in {@skill Perception} and {@skill Stealth} and its Ambusher trait, this gives it some melee shock attack potential, but in most cases it's better off as a sniper. Notably, kenku don't have {@sense darkvision}, as many ambush attackers do. They set up ambushes, but they do so during the daytime, not at night.","A lone kenku may try to pick off an isolated individual, but kenku preying on groups need the force of numbers—at a minimum, two kenku per victim. Using {@skill Stealth}, they either lie hidden or stalk their victims; when the moment is right, they let loose with a surprise volley of Shortbow attacks.","After the initial volley of arrows, one-half to one-third of a flock of kenku will rush forth to engage softer targets in melee with their shortswords, while their bow-wielding allies loose volley after volley at more formidable fighters. Kenku archers always try to maintain at least a 35-foot distance from their targets; if possible, they shoot from 65 to 80 feet away. When an enemy charges, they retreat the same distance, as other allies continue to shoot. If they have the room, kenku archers space themselves out so that an enemy charging one can't easily reach others. A kenku swordfighter Disengages and backs off if a capable melee fighter starts heading its way. Kenku communicate constantly, through a code of seemingly random sound effects, informing one another of the state of play and calling for help when they need it.","Kenku don't have much appetite for a knock-down, drag-out fight. A kenku will alert its allies when it's moderately wounded (reduced to 9 hp or fewer); if it's engaged in melee, it Disengages and retreats. An entire flock of kenku will withdraw and disperse if combat isn't over by their fourth turn—sooner if at least half of them are seriously wounded (reduced to 5 hp or fewer).","Kenku are greedy, but being chaotic neutral, they aren't necessarily malevolent. What they want is precious shiny stuff; killing people is just one way to get it. They understand Common speech and can be bought off for the price of, say, five gold pieces each, or an equivalent amount in gems. Double that price, and you may have bought yourself a favor; quintuple it, and you may have bought yourself a friend, or possibly a retainer.

This seems to me to verge on evil, so I'd say that thri-kreen don't attack other humanoids just to eat them unless they're experiencing some kind of shortage of other foods. That said, having already killed a humanoid for some other reason, they probably wouldn't have any scruples about consuming the corpse.","Thri-kreen have high Dexterity and above-average Strength and Constitution, and they're also fast-moving (speed: 40 feet per round), biasing them toward hardandfast shock attacks.

All these factors point to ambush as their favored strategy.","Their Standing Leap trait is useful for surmounting obstacles, moving vertically between ledges and the ground, and crossing rivers or crevasses, but it doesn't do anything to enhance their speed over level ground—unless the terrain is difficult. Then it gives the thri-kreen a pronounced advantage over opponents who must move on foot, since their movement will usually be cut in half. And the thick, tall grass of the savanna, and the sharp rocks or shifting sands of the desert—the favored habitats of the thri-kreen—usually constitute difficult terrain.","Thri-kreen have AC 15, which isn't quite high enough to make opportunity attacks something they don't need to worry about. Since they can't engage and disengage with impunity, they need to make every attack count.","The biggest thing they have going for them is the poison in their bite. A {@condition poisoned} opponent makes attack rolls with disadvantage, which gives the thrikreen a better chance to elude a counterattack. However, the DC of the thrikreen's poisonous Bite is pretty easy to beat, especially for an opponent with a high Constitution. Thri-kreen are simple-minded, but they're good at choosing targets, so rank-and-file thri-kreen will steer clear of tougher-looking opponents at first. They'll leave those foes to their armed allies.","From a place of hiding, thri-kreen initiate combat when foes come within 30 feet of them, springing out and attacking with the element of surprise, distributing their Bite attacks across all opponents who don't appear to have above-average Constitution, and continuing to fight hand-to-hand until either the opponent is down for the count or they themselves are moderately wounded (reduced to 23 hp or fewer). At that point, they'll chitter for help, and other thrikreen who've managed to poison their opponents will leap over to assist, while they themselves leap away to go fight someone easier.","Thri-kreen communicate constantly during combat, in their impenetrable language, but mostly they just tell each other things like \"I'm hurt,\" \"This one is tough,\" \"This one is fragile but dangerous,\" or \"This one is {@condition poisoned}.\" They exchange information, but they don't really coordinate. If one accidentally engages an opponent that's tougher than it thought, one or two other thri-kreen may come to help, attacking from behind for the flanking bonus (\"Optional Rule: Flanking,\" Dungeon Master's Guide, chapter 8). When half of a group of thrikreen are seriously wounded (reduced to 13 hp or fewer), or when all of them are at least moderately wounded, they'll call a retreat, favoring the {@action Dash} action if they're outnumbered and the {@action Dodge} action otherwise (non-variant thri-kreen aren't quite smart enough to know how to {@action Disengage})."]},{"type":"entries","name":"{@creature Variant Thri-kreen|TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing}","page":65,"entries":["Variant thri-kreen that wield weapons may be considered to be better trained than ordinary thri-kreen, and with this training comes a discipline that does allow them to {@action Disengage}.

First, they approach to a distance of 30 feet and throw two \"chatkchas\" in a single Multiattack action.","After that, they close to melee range and fight with their double-bladed polearms, called \"gythkas,\" also combining two attacks in one Multiattack action. When one of these \"soldier thri-kreen\" is engaged with a melee opponent, a regular thri-kreen will often come up behind it for a flank attack, in the hope of poisoning the foe with its bite.

A werebeast encounter can be awesome action or tragic drama. Werebeasts lend themselves perfectly to horror-mystery adventures, in which the players have no idea which of the villagers is the true villain. They threaten to transmit their lycanthropic curse to any character who fights them hand-to-hand—monsters who can make the player characters into monsters themselves. Practically by definition, werebeast encounters take place at night, when everything is scarier. And if the werewolf ever seems too clichéd an enemy, werebeasts come in four other varieties.","All werebeasts have proficiency in {@skill Perception} and immunity to physical damage from nonmagical, nonsilvered weapons. They also have human forms, beast forms, and hybrid forms; their human forms are their \"true\" forms. My sense as a DM is that they take their beast forms to run around and hunt in the wild, but among people, they take their hybrid forms when their curse is upon them—at any rate, the hybrid form makes for more interesting and challenging combat encounters than the beast form, because it allows them to use their Multiattack action. (The exception to this pattern is the werebear, which has Multiattack in all its forms.) However, if you want to conceal the fact that the PCs are fighting a lycanthrope and not simply a big, ferocious beast, you may opt for the beast form after all, trading a reduction in damage for the increase in likelihood that the PCs will carelessly let themselves fall afoul of the lycanthropic curse.","Although the Shapechanger trait, common to all werebeasts, states that they can use an action to polymorph from one form to another, I'd disregard this, for two reasons. First, there's generally no advantage to it: Any equipment they're carrying isn't transformed, so, for example, a humanoid wearing armor and carrying a sword turns into a beast standing in a pile of armor and staring at a sword on the ground; or a hybrid with natural armor turns into a naked, unarmored, unarmed humanoid. Meanwhile, it's just spent a whole combat round transforming when it could have been, I don't know, attacking or running away? Second, isn't the whole point of lycanthropy that the afflicted individual has little or no control over their transformations? High opportunity cost, no obvious benefit, contradicts werebeast lore: There's only one logical situation in which to use this action, and that's at nightfall or daybreak, when the lycanthrope changes involuntarily.",{"type":"entries","name":"{@creature Werewolf|TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing}","page":67,"entries":["Werewolves in their hybrid form lack any ranged attack, so they're strictly melee fighters.

(Stat blocks aren't written in stone, though. If you want your werewolves to have {@sense darkvision}, give them {@sense darkvision}. Wolves are nocturnal, for pity's sake.)","Their immunity to normal weapons makes them unafraid of opportunity attacks, generally speaking, and as predators, they prefer easy prey to hard prey. Consequently, they attack the weakest first (in a village, that means commoners, not seasoned adventurers), and if struck by a ranged weapon attack or spell attack that does no damage or insignificant damage (5 or less), they immediately {@action Dash} out of sight, thereafter to {@action Hide} again and resume stalking prey. However, if a PC aims a melee attack at a werewolf and either misses or does no damage or insignificant damage, the werewolf counterattacks against that PC, clawing and biting.

Their overall strategy is to wear down, then close in when all their victims are seriously wounded (reduced to 40 percent of their hit point maximum or less—calculate this threshold for your PCs before the session). If a wererat's target charges and engages it in melee, it fights back fearlessly with its shortsword and its teeth, unless and until it's struck by a magic or silvered weapon or a spell attack.

Even so, this group won't be large.","Weretigers keep to remote areas and generally don't hunt humanoids; a weretiger that does is an exception to the rule, and this may be why the PCs are fighting it in the first place. It would also be a reasonable justification for having the weretiger fight in hybrid form, since according to the Monster Manual flavor text, weretigers generally prefer to keep to human form; using the hybrid form will highlight its deviant nature.","Weretigers have {@sense darkvision} in all their forms and proficiency in {@skill Stealth}, so these are nocturnal ambush hunters. Their Pounce feature is similar to a Charge but with the addition of a bonus Bite attack.

What does it consider prey? Probably not a whole party of well-armed adventurers—but then again, weretigers have only average Intelligence, so one may underestimate a group of PCs who aren't flaunting their accomplishments. Still, while a weretiger won't hesitate to attack a single PC and probably wouldn't balk at two, a group of three, four, or five is another matter: They'd have to be weak, or at least weakened, or the weretiger would have to possess some sort of situational advantage, beyond mere darkness. It won't touch a group of six or more, period.","Using the Pounce action in its surprise round, the weretiger gets 15 to 30 feet of movement, a Multiattack action comprising two Claw attacks, and a Bite attack as a bonus action. After that, is there any reason for the weretiger to bother drawing a scimitar and slashing away? Nah. As long as it's engaged in melee, it continues to use its Claw/Claw Multiattack.","Like other werebeasts, a weretiger knows that magic and silvered weapons can hurt or kill it, as can spells, and it will withdraw quickly when moderately injured (reduced to 84 or fewer hp), because anything that can deal a moderate wound to a weretiger can probably do worse as well. It Dashes away, then Hides as soon as the PCs lose sight of it. But as with wererats, the encounter probably won't end there, because the PCs will have been hunting the weretiger in the first place.

If the PCs get too close—say, within bowshot range—this is the rare instance in which it makes sense for the weretiger to Shapechange from humanoid to tiger form, because in this form, it has a movement speed of 40 feet and thus can more easily run away.

Rather than humanoids tainted with a bestial curse, they're jackals tainted with a human curse. Like lycanthropes, however, they typically adopt a hybrid form during combat.","Jackalweres have an unusual ability contour: high Dexterity but merely average Strength and Constitution, combined with above-average Intelligence. This is a contour usually associated with a sniper or a spellcaster, but jackalweres' attacks are largely melee-based. This suggests three things. First, jackalweres are shock attackers, not well suited to drawn-out combat, and will abandon a fight quickly if they don't immediately get the upper hand. Second, they rely heavily on guile. And third, the successful use of their Sleep Gaze feature—the closest thing they have to spellcasting—figures prominently in their strategy.","Jackalweres are proficient in {@skill Deception} and {@skill Stealth}—here's the guile, as well as a potential way to strike with surprise. They're immune to physical damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, giving them a little more staying power than they'd have otherwise. Since they have only 18 hp to begin with, though, that's not saying a lot. They have the Pack Tactics trait, which suggests that another key part of their strategy is not starting fights at all unless they outnumber their victims substantially. (The Monster Manual flavor text notes that they often have ordinary jackals fighting alongside them, but these pose little or no threat to intermediate- or higher-level adventurers.)","Sleep Gaze is weak, as monster features go. All it takes to resist is a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. The average adventurer has a 60 percent chance of succeeding on that roll; the average cleric, druid, paladin, warlock, or wizard, as well as any gnome, a 75 percent or better chance; and Fey Ancestry makes elves entirely immune to it. But that assumes one jackalwere and one target. Two jackalweres against one target... well, that's like giving the target disadvantage on the roll, reducing their chances of success to 36 or 56 percent (elves remain immune). How about three against one? Chances reduced to 22 and 42 percent. Four against one, 13 and 32 percent. (Note, as usual, the careful and highly literal phrasing of the feature: \"A creature that successfully saves against the effect is immune to this jackalwere's gaze for the next 24 hours\"—emphasis mine. Not any jackalwere's gaze, just this jackalwere's.)","Unlike a lot of monsters, jackalweres are intelligent—crafty, even. They may not be able to judge how experienced a PC is, but they can tell whether one is carrying a holy symbol or a staff, and they know that means they'll probably be a harder target. They also know that gnomes are resistant to their special ability and that elves are immune to it.","Their goal is to end the fight in the first round if they can. Thus, for jackalweres to initiate an encounter, their numbers must total the following: three per elf (to kill them), four per gnome or non-elf who displays a holy symbol or wields a staff (to overwhelm their resistance to Sleep Gaze), and two per other non-gnome/non-elf (ditto).","As an example, let's look at a six-character party I ran a campaign for. It consisted of a human barbarian, a halfling ranger/rogue, a dwarf ranger, a human paladin, an elf sorcerer, and a dwarf druid. A pack of jackalweres would have to number at least seventeen to be willing to attack this party. Two of them would use Sleep Gaze against the barbarian, two against the halfling, two against the dwarf ranger, four against the paladin, and four against the druid; the remaining three would draw scimitars and attack the elf sorcerer directly, using Pack Tactics to gain advantage on their attack rolls.","That's in the first round of combat. In the second, Sleep Gaze won't work anymore, because any foe who's still awake will have saved successfully against each of their assailants. On the other hand, any victims of the jackalweres who haven't been put to sleep will be greatly outnumbered, and all the attacking jackalweres will gain advantage from Pack Tactics. If a third round of combat isn't enough for them to subdue all their foes, they'll all {@action Disengage} and run away in the fourth round.","\"Jackalweres kidnap humanoids for their lamia masters,\" the flavor text informs us. \"A jackalwere's magical gaze renders a foe {@condition unconscious}, allowing the monster to bind a creature or drag it away.\" What if a pack of jackalweres aren't working for a lamia? They're gonna eat you, son. They're chaotic evil. Once a target is {@condition unconscious}, jackalweres lower their blades and switch to Bite attacks—which do critical damage against {@condition unconscious} targets.","Because jackalweres won't fight without an overwhelming numerical advantage, think very carefully about pitting low-level PCs against them if they're hunting independently (as opposed to seeking captives for a boss lamia). Up to about level 4, any number of jackalweres willing to tangle with your PCs will be too many for them to handle. The sweet spot at which they'll be an appropriate challenge for your PCs is level 5. At level 6 or 7, they'll be a serious threat only as minions fighting alongside a lamia. At level 8 or above, you can safely play them for comedy.","An individual jackalwere that's seriously injured (reduced to 7 hp or fewer) will first {@action Disengage}, then Dash away. If at least half of a jackalwere pack has fled or been slain, the rest {@action Dash} away without bothering to {@action Disengage}.

Its Strength and Constitution are average, its Intelligence and Wisdom only marginally higher (not enough even to get a plus to their modifiers). This is the profile of a sniper. Drow are armed with both shortswords (thrusting weapons akin to an ancient Greek xiphos) and hand crossbows, but their lower Constitution relative to their Dexterity strongly suggests a preference for the ranged weapon over the melee weapon.

The combination of double-range {@sense darkvision} and Sunlight Sensitivity implies a creature that not only gets around well in darkness but is averse to light, so why would a drow want to cast dancing lights or faerie fire?","The answer is that the ideal illumination for a creature with {@sense darkvision} isn't total darkness but rather dim light (if it really preferred total darkness, it would have {@sense blindsight}). Dancing lights and faerie fire shed dim light, not bright light, which is perfect.","Meanwhile, darkness fills a 15-foot-radius sphere (engulfing three creatures on average, again per the Targets in Area of Effect table) with magical darkness that blinds even creatures with {@sense darkvision}. Only magical light can penetrate it, but it has to be magical light shed by a spell of 3rd level or higher. The drow's dancing lights and faerie fire aren't enough: The darkness will swallow them up. This spell seems to be useful only as a way of temporarily debilitating enemies, particularly spellcasters who need to be able to see their targets.","Drow never fight aboveground in daylight. Only in the rarest instances—and out of necessity—do they venture aboveground in daylight at all.","All drow stat blocks include some form of poison. In the basic drow stat block, this poison requires a DC 13 Constitution save and imposes the {@condition poisoned} condition, along with the {@condition unconscious} condition if the target fails their saving throw by 5 or more. Referring to \"Poisons\" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, this is \"drow poison,\" which the drow manufacture themselves, so it stands to reason that they'd use it routinely. The drow's hand crossbow bolts are {@condition poisoned}, but the shortsword isn't—yet another reason to assume they prefer sniping over melee.","Incidentally, since dwarves are resistant to poison (and also happen to be their number one competitors for the best underground real estate), it stands to reason that drow would find dwarves' presence particularly irritating, possibly enough to focus their attacks on them.","So here's our profile of drow combat: They patrol their caverns in darkness, using {@skill Stealth}. They can detect enemies up to 120 feet away. When enemies come near, they fan out and {@action Hide}. When the player characters wander into their midst, one drow in the patrol (or two, if one isn't enough) casts faerie fire to illuminate the interlopers, whereupon the rest attack with surprise, using their {@condition poisoned} hand crossbows, and paying special attention to any dwarf in the party. Between the subterranean darkness and the drow poison, once the PCs get their chance to act in the subsequent round, many of them will have disadvantage on their attack rolls, while the drow will have advantage—an advantage they'll retain even if the PCs fire up torches, lanterns, or light spells, thanks to faerie fire.","Being accustomed to underground combat, the drow will notice when one of their targets is trying to hide, and if that target isn't already lit up with faerie fire, the nearest drow will cast dancing lights to \"chase\" that PC with dim light, so that the drow don't suffer disadvantage on their {@skill Perception} checks to contest the character's {@skill Stealth}. Because the spell creates four independently movable lights, the pursuit doesn't have to be exact, and the drow can illuminate a wide swath around wherever the PC is likely to be hiding. On the flip side, if a spellcaster is causing persistent problems for the drow, and it's far enough away from the nonspellcasting PCs, the nearest one will drop a darkness sphere on it.","Drow may or may not take prisoners, but they are absolutely unwilling to be taken prisoner.

If so, then after striking once with Dive Attack, their next action will be to {@action Disengage} and fly back up into the air, setting up for another Dive Attack on the following turn. If they're not trained warriors, then once they've closed with an enemy, they won't have much choice but to try to finish the fight in melee. Without Flyby or an equivalent trait, trying to get airborne again for another Dive Attack would invite an opportunity strike, and their Armor Class and hit points aren't good enough for them to risk that.","Aarakocra attacking foes that lack ranged attacks, or that wield only throwable weapons, slings, hand crossbows, or other missiles with very short range, may spend one or more rounds flying down to a height of 30 feet, throwing a javelin, then flying back up out of reach again until their foes are seriously wounded (reduced to 40 percent or less of their hit point maximum).

Their Pounce feature is similar to a Charge but with the addition of a bonus Bite attack. They can wield longbows, but I think this is something that ordinary weretigers would use to defend their territory; a rogue weretiger would favor the potent melee combo offered by the Pounce feature.","Therefore the rogue weretiger (not to be confused with a weretiger rogue) stalks its prey from hiding, then Pounces with surprise. What does it consider prey? Probably not a whole party of well-armed adventurers—but then again, weretigers have only average Intelligence, so one may underestimate a group of PCs who aren't flaunting their accomplishments. Still, while a weretiger won't hesitate to attack a single PC and probably wouldn't balk at two, a group of three, four, or five is another matter: They'd have to be weak, or at least weakened, or the weretiger would have to possess some sort of situational advantage, beyond mere darkness.

Rather than humanoids tainted with a bestial curse, they're jackals tainted with a human curse. Like lycanthropes, however, they typically adopt a hybrid form during combat.","Jackalweres have an unusual ability contour: high Dexterity but merely average Strength and Constitution, combined with above-average Intelligence. This is a contour usually associated with a sniper or a spellcaster, but jackalweres' attacks are largely melee-based. This suggests three things. First, jackalweres are shock attackers, not well suited to drawn-out combat, and will abandon a fight quickly if they don't immediately get the upper hand. Second, they rely heavily on guile. And third, the successful use of their Sleep Gaze feature—the closest thing they have to spellcasting—figures prominently in their strategy.","Jackalweres are proficient in {@skill Deception} and {@skill Stealth}—here's the guile, as well as a potential way to strike with surprise. They're immune to physical damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, giving them a little more staying power than they'd have otherwise. Since they have only 18 hp to begin with, though, that's not saying a lot. They have the Pack Tactics trait, which suggests that another key part of their strategy is not starting fights at all unless they outnumber their victims substantially. (The Monster Manual flavor text notes that they often have ordinary jackals fighting alongside them, but these pose little or no threat to intermediate- or higher-level adventurers.)","Sleep Gaze is weak, as monster features go. All it takes to resist is a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. The average adventurer has a 60 percent chance of succeeding on that roll; the average cleric, druid, paladin, warlock, or wizard, as well as any gnome, a 75 percent or better chance; and Fey Ancestry makes elves entirely immune to it. But that assumes one jackalwere and one target. Two jackalweres against one target... well, that's like giving the target disadvantage on the roll, reducing their chances of success to 36 or 56 percent (elves remain immune). How about three against one? Chances reduced to 22 and 42 percent. Four against one, 13 and 32 percent. (Note, as usual, the careful and highly literal phrasing of the feature: \"A creature that successfully saves against the effect is immune to this jackalwere's gaze for the next 24 hours\"—emphasis mine. Not any jackalwere's gaze, just this jackalwere's.)","Unlike a lot of monsters, jackalweres are intelligent—crafty, even. They may not be able to judge how experienced a PC is, but they can tell whether one is carrying a holy symbol or a staff, and they know that means they'll probably be a harder target. They also know that gnomes are resistant to their special ability and that elves are immune to it.","Their goal is to end the fight in the first round if they can. Thus, for jackalweres to initiate an encounter, their numbers must total the following: three per elf (to kill them), four per gnome or non-elf who displays a holy symbol or wields a staff (to overwhelm their resistance to Sleep Gaze), and two per other non-gnome/non-elf (ditto).","As an example, let's look at a six-character party I ran a campaign for. It consisted of a human barbarian, a halfling ranger/rogue, a dwarf ranger, a human paladin, an elf sorcerer, and a dwarf druid. A pack of jackalweres would have to number at least seventeen to be willing to attack this party. Two of them would use Sleep Gaze against the barbarian, two against the halfling, two against the dwarf ranger, four against the paladin, and four against the druid; the remaining three would draw scimitars and attack the elf sorcerer directly, using Pack Tactics to gain advantage on their attack rolls.","That's in the first round of combat. In the second, Sleep Gaze won't work anymore, because any foe who's still awake will have saved successfully against each of their assailants. On the other hand, any victims of the jackalweres who haven't been put to sleep will be greatly outnumbered, and all the attacking jackalweres will gain advantage from Pack Tactics. If a third round of combat isn't enough for them to subdue all their foes, they'll all {@action Disengage} and run away in the fourth round.","\"Jackalweres kidnap humanoids for their lamia masters,\" the flavor text informs us. \"A jackalwere's magical gaze renders a foe {@condition unconscious}, allowing the monster to bind a creature or drag it away.\" What if a pack of jackalweres aren't working for a lamia? They're gonna eat you, son. They're chaotic evil. Once a target is {@condition unconscious}, jackalweres lower their blades and switch to Bite attacks—which do critical damage against {@condition unconscious} targets.","Because jackalweres won't fight without an overwhelming numerical advantage, think very carefully about pitting low-level PCs against them if they're hunting independently (as opposed to seeking captives for a boss lamia). Up to about level 4, any number of jackalweres willing to tangle with your PCs will be too many for them to handle. The sweet spot at which they'll be an appropriate challenge for your PCs is level 5. At level 6 or 7, they'll be a serious threat only as minions fighting alongside a lamia. At level 8 or above, you can safely play them for comedy.","An individual jackalwere that's seriously injured (reduced to 7 hp or fewer) will first {@action Disengage}, then Dash away. If at least half of a jackalwere pack has fled or been slain, the rest {@action Dash} away without bothering to {@action Disengage}. If a party of adventurers initiates combat against them—most likely, by catching them off guard—and they lack the numbers they'd need to start a fight themselves, they don't stand their ground.

So let's say that this drow is something more akin to a drow guard—a trained, regular fighter or scout.","Dexterity is the drow's highest stat, followed by Charisma. Its Strength and Constitution are average, its Intelligence and Wisdom only marginally higher (not enough even to get a plus to their modifiers). This is the profile of a sniper. Drow are armed with both shortswords (thrusting weapons akin to an ancient Greek xiphos) and hand crossbows, but their lower Constitution relative to their Dexterity strongly suggests a preference for the ranged weapon over the melee weapon. They have proficiency in {@skill Stealth}, marking them as ambush fighters.","They also have the innate ability to cast dancing lights at will and darkness and faerie fire once per day each. The combination of double-range {@sense darkvision} and Sunlight Sensitivity implies a creature that not only gets around well in darkness but is averse to light, so why would a drow want to cast dancing lights or faerie fire?","The answer is that the ideal illumination for a creature with {@sense darkvision} isn't total darkness but rather dim light (if it really preferred total darkness, it would have {@sense blindsight}). Dancing lights and faerie fire shed dim light, not bright light, which is perfect.","Meanwhile, darkness fills a 15-foot-radius sphere (engulfing three creatures on average, again per the Targets in Area of Effect table) with magical darkness that blinds even creatures with {@sense darkvision}. Only magical light can penetrate it, but it has to be magical light shed by a spell of 3rd level or higher. The drow's dancing lights and faerie fire aren't enough: The darkness will swallow them up. This spell seems to be useful only as a way of temporarily debilitating enemies, particularly spellcasters who need to be able to see their targets.","Drow never fight aboveground in daylight. Only in the rarest instances—and out of necessity—do they venture aboveground in daylight at all.","All drow stat blocks include some form of poison. In the basic drow stat block, this poison requires a DC 13 Constitution save and imposes the {@condition poisoned} condition, along with the {@condition unconscious} condition if the target fails their saving throw by 5 or more. Referring to \"Poisons\" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, this is \"drow poison,\" which the drow manufacture themselves, so it stands to reason that they'd use it routinely. The drow's hand crossbow bolts are {@condition poisoned}, but the shortsword isn't—yet another reason to assume they prefer sniping over melee.","Incidentally, since dwarves are resistant to poison (and also happen to be their number one competitors for the best underground real estate), it stands to reason that drow would find dwarves' presence particularly irritating, possibly enough to focus their attacks on them.","So here's our profile of drow combat: They patrol their caverns in darkness, using {@skill Stealth}. They can detect enemies up to 120 feet away. When enemies come near, they fan out and {@action Hide}. When the player characters wander into their midst, one drow in the patrol (or two, if one isn't enough) casts faerie fire to illuminate the interlopers, whereupon the rest attack with surprise, using their {@condition poisoned} hand crossbows, and paying special attention to any dwarf in the party. Between the subterranean darkness and the drow poison, once the PCs get their chance to act in the subsequent round, many of them will have disadvantage on their attack rolls, while the drow will have advantage—an advantage they'll retain even if the PCs fire up torches, lanterns, or light spells, thanks to faerie fire.","Being accustomed to underground combat, the drow will notice when one of their targets is trying to hide, and if that target isn't already lit up with faerie fire, the nearest drow will cast dancing lights to \"chase\" that PC with dim light, so that the drow don't suffer disadvantage on their {@skill Perception} checks to contest the character's {@skill Stealth}. Because the spell creates four independently movable lights, the pursuit doesn't have to be exact, and the drow can illuminate a wide swath around wherever the PC is likely to be hiding. On the flip side, if a spellcaster is causing persistent problems for the drow, and it's far enough away from the nonspellcasting PCs, the nearest one will drop a darkness sphere on it.","Drow may or may not take prisoners, but they are absolutely unwilling to be taken prisoner.

They're low-Strength and high-Dexterity, with a very good {@skill Stealth} modifier. Their Intelligence and Wisdom are in the average range. They possess {@sense darkvision} and the Nimble Escape feature, which allows them to {@action Disengage} or Hide as a bonus action—very important to their action economy.","Because of their {@sense darkvision}, goblins frequently attack under cover of darkness, when their targets may be effectively {@condition blinded} (attack rolls against a {@condition blinded} creature have advantage, while the {@condition blinded} creature's attack rolls have disadvantage). They'll also attack from hiding as much as possible, making use of their high {@skill Stealth} modifier, and doing so in dim light decreases the likelihood that they'll be discovered, since many player characters will have disadvantage on {@skill Perception} checks that rely on sight.","A picture of goblin combat is starting to coalesce, and at the center of it is a strategy of ambush.","A typical goblin combat turn goes Shortbow (action), move, {@action Hide} (bonus action). Because they attack from hiding, they roll with advantage. Regardless of whether they hit or miss, the attack gives their position away, so they change it immediately, because they can. (The sequence is important. Whenever possible, a goblin must end its turn hidden; otherwise, it's vulnerable. Move/{@action Hide}/Shortbow would achieve the same offensive result but leave the goblin exposed to retaliation between turns.)","Being a Small creature, a goblin has a good chance of Hiding successfully behind the trunk of a mature tree; even if it fails, it will still enjoy three-quarters cover (+5 AC). But since you can't hide while someone is looking directly at you, goblins have to use their movement to scramble out of the PCs' field of view, meaning they have to be close enough for their own 30-foot movement speed to describe a significant arc. At the same time, they don't want to be so close that a PC could close the gap between them and attack. So the optimal distance from the targets of their ambush is about 40 feet, no closer—and they don't want to move farther from the PCs than 80 feet, their bows' maximum range for normal shooting.","As long as they can stay out of the PCs' reach, they'll use this tactic over and over. Suppose, however, that a PC does manage to close with one of them. In that case, the goblin Disengages (bonus action) first. Then, depending on how great a threat the PC poses, it either Dashes (action) out of reach—forcing the PC to use a {@action Dash} action as well if they want to catch up—or, if it thinks it may be able to finish the PC off, moves its full distance to a place of cover, then Hides (action) again, preparing to attack with advantage on its next turn.","Incidentally, the goblins aren't trying to stay together as a group. They aren't looking out for their buddies—goblins don't do that sort of thing. They are, however, trying to goad the PCs into splitting up.","Goblins are squishy: They have only 7 hp. One good hit will seriously wound them—and also mean that their genius sniping strategy has failed. Therefore, a goblin reduced to just 1 or 2 hp flees the scene, end of story. But a moderately wounded goblin (3 or 4 hp) is thirsty and tries to regain the upper hand. It stalks the PC who wounded it, first retreating to a safe distance, then Hiding and moving with {@skill Stealth} until it can get back to around 40 feet from its quarry, at which point it returns to its Shortbow/move/{@action Hide} sniping tactic. A captured goblin surrenders immediately and grovels for mercy, counting on its ability to escape as soon as its captor's attention wanders.","What if the PCs have the good sense to take cover themselves? Goblins aren't brilliant, but they aren't stupid either. They won't waste arrows on a target that's behind three-quarters cover, because that would completely negate the advantage they gain when shooting from hiding. Instead, a goblin stealthily repositions itself alongside or behind its target before shooting and giving its own position away.","A goblin that finishes off its target doesn't immediately go hunting after other targets. If another is already in view, it attacks that one. If not, the greedy goblin first ransacks the body of its victim for anything valuable. A clever and stealthy PC who's counter-stalking the goblins can exploit this weakness.","So far, the entire discussion has been about ranged attacks. Goblins carry scimitars as well, but they don't use these out in the open, because there's no advantage to it. The only time a goblin willingly engages in melee combat is when it has some other overwhelming advantage, such as a combination of numbers, darkness, and the ability to flank, which in fifth edition D&D means attacking from two opposite sides of a target creature. (Front-and-side isn't enough to gain advantage on attack rolls. See \"Optional Rule: Flanking,\" Dungeon Master's Guide, chapter 8.)","A goblin's +4 attack modifier isn't quite good enough to give it two-to-one odds of hitting an armored enemy by itself, but when advantage is brought into play, a hit is almost guaranteed. If three goblins surround a PC in the dark, the chances are very good that they'll land three hits and not have to worry about retaliation. That being said, if those three hits don't finish the PC off, the goblins will realize that they've bitten off more than they can chew, and on their next turn, they'll {@action Disengage} (bonus action), go scampering off into the darkness (movement), and {@action Hide} (action) someplace where they may later be able to land a surprise hit on a wounded foe.","Also, goblins can tell the difference between a creature that's lost in the dark and one that has {@sense darkvision}. They won't attack the latter close up if they can avoid it; instead, they'll prefer to shoot with their shortbows. However, in the narrow passages of a cave, establishing a good line of sight may not always be possible, and melee may be the only way to attack. If this happens, they'll use their knowledge of the terrain to tease the party into overextending itself: A lead goblin may use its Scimitar attack (action), {@action Disengage} (bonus action), then retreat down the passageway (movement) until it comes out into a more open cavern where it and several other goblins can all jump the first PC who emerges with Readied attack actions. Meanwhile, while the PCs are being drawn forward, other goblins may shoot or stab at them opportunistically from any side passages that exist along the way.","There is one other circumstance when goblins may engage in melee fighting: when commanded to do so by hobgoblins or bugbears, which goblins fear and defer to. They'll do it, but they won't like it. They know they're not good at it; they'd rather be sniping. If pressed into an infantry unit, they'll fight without coordination and desert at the first opportunity. However, that doesn't mean they won't keep attacking if they think there's something to be gained by doing it their way.","Goblins recognize the value of stealth and surprise, and they're not about to let anyone get the same advantage against them. They make extensive use of alarms and traps, but since they're not great inventors, by and large, most of these are crude: metal junk that makes a racket when disturbed, falling rocks, pits (with or without punji sticks), simple snares. Every once in a while, though, a lucky goblin may get its hands on a hunter's trap that both restrains its victim and does damage. These are prized possessions, and the goblins use them to protect their most important locations."]}}}}},{"name":"Goblin Boss","source":"TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing","_copy":{"name":"Goblin Boss","source":"MM","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":{"type":"entries","name":"Tactics","entries":["The goblin boss is distinguished from ordinary goblins by its Multiattack and Redirect Attack features and by the fact that it doesn't use a bow.

The goblin boss uses its reaction to avoid a hit on itself and to cause it to land on one of its goblin minions instead. What a jerk!

Fighting in a group, it begins on the front line with everyone else, using its Multiattack action to attack twice with its scimitar (note that the goblin boss's Multiattack has disadvantage on the second swing). As soon as it's taken even one hit, however, it changes tactics: After its Multiattack action, it Disengages (bonus action) and moves 15 feet to a position behind the front line where melee opponents can't reach it and it has \"meat cover\" against ranged attacks. On subsequent rounds, it moves up to 15 feet into a nearby hole in the front line, Multiattacks (action), Disengages (bonus action), and moves back behind the front line again.

On the other hand, they have no {@skill Stealth} proficiency and no Nimble Escape.","Hobgoblins move and attack at night, when their {@sense darkvision} gives them an advantage over PCs without it; if they don't have the advantage of darkness, they'll attack only with at least a two-to-one numerical advantage. In groups consisting only of hobgoblins, they move in tight teams of four to six. If there are multiple such teams, one consists of archers, positioned between 60 and 150 feet from the action. With goblin troops, they have to be careful: Hobgoblins don't lack the courage to fight on the front line, but they know that goblins do. Rather than set an example that the goblins won't follow, they give commands from behind the front line, where they can keep an eye on the goblins and shoot at opponents with their longbows. Martial Advantage helps them in this instance, even though they're not engaged in melee themselves, as long as they're choosing targets that the goblins are engaging in melee.","The more hobgoblin teams that are engaged in melee, the more sophisticated tactics they'll use. For instance, if there are three, one engages directly, one shoots from a distance, and one moves to whichever flank looks weaker before engaging. If there are four, one moves to each flank. Five or more try to encircle the PCs. These movements take place before the battle begins—hobgoblins are intelligent and disciplined enough to prepare. They also take place at a sufficient distance that their lack of {@skill Stealth} won't be a hindrance.","Hobgoblins don't flee when they're losing; they execute an orderly retreat. When at least two hobgoblins in a team are seriously injured (reduced to 4 hp or fewer) or killed, the team begins to fall back, starting with the most injured hobgoblins. These {@action Disengage} and retreat at their full movement speed. On the next round, the two next-most injured {@action Disengage} and also retreat at their full movement speed, while the previous two fall back only 5 feet, so as to remain in contact with the hobgoblins that are now joining them. Meanwhile, in this round, the hobgoblin archer team, if there is one, notices the retreat and focuses its arrows on any potential pursuers, in order to cover the retreat. On the third round, any hobgoblins left in the team {@action Disengage} and retreat at full movement speed, joining up with those that have already retreated. They carry out this same maneuver repeatedly, until no enemy is engaging with them anymore.","Despite being the very model of discipline otherwise, according to the Monster Manual, hobgoblins flip their lids when they see an elf. They attack elves first, \"even if doing so would be a tactical error.\" Does this mean they'll charge into combat prematurely, during daylight, with inadequate reconnaissance, just because they see an elf in the party's camp? That's the DM's call. You could play them this way, but given the extent to which they're built up as being militarily savvy, I'd say that before the action starts, their disciplined nature prevails—they simply construct their battle plans around taking out the elves first. Once the battle commences, though, maybe they allow a human warrior to score free hits on them while they concentrate their attacks on an elf warrior. Maybe the hobgoblin archers keep shooting at an elf mage when they should be covering their fellow hobgoblins' retreat.

The hobgoblin warlord's Multiattack allows three consecutive melee swings in one action. The Longsword attack does the most damage, so it's the default, but when is Shield Bash a reasonable alternative? Assuming a hit, Shield Bash does, on average, 2 hp less damage than a Longsword attack, so the crux is whether the chance to knock the opponent {@condition prone} is worth these forfeited points. Attacks against a {@condition prone} opponent have advantage, which raises the probability of a hit by an average of about 20 percentage points. If the hobgoblin warlord uses the Multiattack sequence Shield Bash/Longsword/Longsword, this means it will have advantage on two Longsword attacks after a successful bash. The longsword does an {@footnote average of 8 damage on a hit|In fifth edition D&D play, the general rule is to round fractions down. In this book, while analyzing damage probabilistically rather than applying it to a PC or monster, I round fractions to the nearest whole number, with one-half rounded to the nearest even whole number.}, 15 damage on two. Twenty percent of that is 3, so using Shield Bash before striking twice with a longsword increases the expected damage of those two hits by 3 hp—if it works.","The trouble is, the DC 14 for Strength saving throws against a Shield Bash isn't very high. Unmodified, the hobgoblin warlord has just shy of a two-thirds chance of knocking its opponent down. Modified by the opponent's Strength—and keep in mind that it's probably the party's toughest front-line fighters who'll confront the hobgoblin warlord—the chance of success recedes to the neighborhood of fifty-fifty, even less against PCs who get to add their proficiency modifiers to their Strength saves.","Hobgoblins aren't dumb; hobgoblin warlords even less so. They know from experience that a weak opponent (one with a negative Strength modifier) usually won't withstand a Shield Bash, but a stronger opponent often will. However, they also know that if one or more of their allies can land melee attacks on a {@condition prone} target before they get up—if the advantage applies to their allies' attack rolls as well, not just to the hobgoblin warlord's two attacks—then the expected value of Shield Bash is much more likely to exceed its opportunity cost. Also, in most instances, if an ally of a hobgoblin warlord is near enough to take whacks at its target, it's near enough for the warlord's Martial Advantage trait to kick in, which nearly triples the average damage of one of its Longsword attacks and roughly doubles the average total of the two together. Plus, if the ally is also a hobgoblin, its own Martial Advantage comes into play as well.

The difference is, while goblins engage in hit-and-run sniper attacks, the bugbear lies hidden until its foe comes within reach (or creeps up on its foe unseen until it comes within reach), then springs out and smashes it to a pulp. It's indiscriminate in its target selection: It attacks whoever it can get at first. It doesn't distinguish between targets that look weaker and targets that look stronger.

That's the crux of how kobolds ought to fight. Kobold society has evolved to be highly cooperative. Unlike goblins, forever squabbling and looking out for themselves, kobolds instinctively work together, even without having to discuss what they're doing.","A kobold attack begins as an ambush: Hiding kobolds (which aren't exceptionally stealthy but may gain the element of surprise anyway, since they have decently high Dexterity and live in dark places) pop up and pelt the party with sling stones from 20 to 30 feet away in order to soften them up. This lasts until either the player characters close with the kobolds or the kobolds have lost any advantage they had, such as the PCs being {@condition restrained} by a trap or {@condition blinded} by darkness.

Any kobold that's the only one left fighting a single foe retreats, possibly regrouping with other kobolds fighting a different foe. However, a seriously wounded kobold (1 or 2 hp remaining) turns and runs. It's not smart enough to {@action Disengage} to avoid an opportunity attack; it Dashes instead. If at any point the attacking kobolds no longer outnumber the front-line PCs by at least three to one, they'll withdraw. They can't do much damage on their own—on average, just 4 hp per hit—so they have to make every attack count. But kobolds using Pack Tactics against a target wearing chain mail can still deal damage two times out of three.","That's basically it. Kobolds don't get bonus actions or reactions (other than opportunity attacks) that might increase the complexity of their behavior. They have Pack Tactics, so they attack in packs. When attacking as a pack no longer works, they cut their losses. They also know to stay out of bright sunlight. If their enemies retreat into a well-lit area, kobolds simply won't pursue.

Curiously, they have proficiency in a social skill: {@skill Intimidation}.

They charge, they fight hand-to-hand, and they retreat only with the greatest reluctance when seriously wounded. (Being fanatical valuers of physical courage, orcs—unlike most creatures—are willing to fight to the death.)","The Aggressive trait applies chiefly to one situation: when a group of orcs is between 30 and 60 feet away from the player characters. As a DM, you should therefore assume that first contact with a group of orcs always takes place at this distance, that the orcs will be initially hostile, and that they'll charge the second they decide talking is boring. However, the fact that orcs have any social skill at all—even if it's just {@skill Intimidation}—suggests that there ought to be some opportunity to interact before combat begins.","Any parley with the orcs will be brief (no more than a handful of chances to cajole, bluff, or bully them) and somewhat one-sided, as the orcs will issue nothing but demands and threats. At this point, any hostile action on the PCs' part, including moving closer than 30 feet for any reason, ends the parley immediately and initiates combat.","However, a smooth talker may be able to stave off an attack by making a Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check with disadvantage—against DC 15, say, or maybe DC 20 if the orcs are there for a specific purpose, such as guarding something or staking a territorial claim. If it succeeds, the orcs' attitude shifts from hostile to indifferent; if it fails, however, give the party only one more chance to successfully reach a détente.","The PCs may also try to bluff their way past the orcs by making a Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check with disadvantage (no disadvantage if they've been talked into indifference), opposed by the orcs' Intelligence or Wisdom, depending on the nature of the bluff. If they succeed, the orcs believe their lie. If the lie fails, however, the orcs attack immediately.","Finally, a PC may try to threaten back! Have them make a DC 20 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check, opposed by a Wisdom check for the orcs. If the PC and the orcs both succeed, the orcs appraise the situation, attacking immediately if they're stronger than the party but retreating if they're weaker. (Before the encounter begins, use the XP Thresholds by Character Level table in chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine which side is stronger. If the orcs' adjusted experience points would make them a Deadly encounter for the party, consider them stronger; otherwise, consider them weaker.) If the PC succeeds on their {@skill Intimidation} check and the orcs fail their Wisdom check, the orcs are rattled, their attitude shifts to indifferent, and the PC gets advantage on their next social skill check with the orcs. If the PC fails, the orcs attack.","Orcs initiate combat by charging, using Aggressive (bonus action) plus their movement to close the distance between themselves and the party's front line, followed immediately by attacking with their greataxes (action). From this point on, it's a slugfest. As long as the orcs aren't seriously injured, they keep fighting, using their Greataxe action every round and moving on to the next PC back if they hew down one in the front line. If there's a PC between 30 and 60 feet past the one the orc has just felled, it has a chance to use Aggressive again—so why not? This should create a moment of excitement in your session and put a healthy fear of orcs into your archers and spellslingers.","Despite their aggression and stupidity, even orcs know when they're overmatched. Depending on how you, the DM, believe that this particular group of orcs should act, a seriously injured orc (reduced to 6 hp or fewer) may be willing to fight to the death for honor's sake, or it may possess more of a will to survive, in which case it will {@action Disengage} and retreat its full movement distance. (My own inclination is to have orcs that see their fellows retreating successfully be more willing to retreat themselves, while orcs whose fellows have been slain will fight to the death themselves.) An orc that finds itself fighting two or more foes rather than just one tries to reposition itself so that it has to fight only one, if possible. Since this will always involve moving out of at least one opponent's reach, there are three possible ways: {@action Dodge}, then reposition; {@action Disengage}, then reposition; or reposition, risking an opportunity strike, then attack. The first two, frankly, strike me as un-orc-like, while the third strikes me as very orc-like. If there's no way for the orc to evade its extra attackers without their simply closing with it again, then {@action Disengage}/retreat seems like the most likely response—either that or, if its fellows have been slain, fiercely fighting to the death.","The fact that a group of orcs has retreated doesn't mean combat is over. The survivors long for payback. Orcs aren't stealthy, so they won't stalk the characters, but they'll certainly keep an eye out for the PCs as long as they're in that vicinity.

It possesses the orog's Strength and Constitution, a high Charisma, less Intelligence than an orog but more than an average orc, Multiattack ability, and proficiency bonuses on several types of saving throws, plus two fearsome features: Gruumsh's Fury and Battle Cry.","Gruumsh's Fury is a passive trait that increases the orc war chief's weapon damage by {@dice 1d8} on every hit. This doesn't affect its tactics at all; it simply makes the orc war chief a wickedly effective damage dealer. The real game-changer is Battle Cry, a once-per-day power that gives the orc war chief's warriors advantage on attack rolls for the next turn. The effectiveness of Battle Cry is maximized when it can buff the greatest number of orcs. Therefore, there's no reason at all for the orc war chief to wait to use it, save one: The war chief has to forgo its own attack to use it, because Battle Cry is an action. The cost/benefit analysis hinges on which is expected to do more damage: a horde of orcs with advantage or a single orc war chief swinging its greataxe.","By itself, an orc war chief, with +6 to hit, has a 70 percent chance to hit an AC 13 opponent. It does an average of 15 damage with every hit, and it gets two swings per Multiattack action. Therefore, its expected damage per round is 21. A regular orc, with +5 to hit, has a 65 percent chance to hit an AC 13 opponent; it does an average of 10 damage with every hit, and it gets only one chance per round. Ordinarily, therefore, its expected damage per round is 6. If the orc attacks with advantage, however, its chance to hit increases from 65 percent to 88 percent, so its expected damage increases to 8. In short, giving a single orc advantage on its attack roll increases its expected damage by about 2 (2.1, to be exact). From this, we can determine that the orc war chief will prefer to use Battle Cry rather than charge with its troops and Multiattack when it commands a force of no fewer than ten ordinary orcs.","Would an orc war chief have any way to calculate this? No. But it would know intuitively, from its battlefield experience (which comes mostly from fighting other orcs, who have AC 13—that's why I chose that number), that issuing a Battle Cry before charging seems to make a difference in a group of ten or more orc warriors, while in a smaller group, it doesn't.","All that being said, the Battle Cry action also allows the orc war chief to make a single attack as a bonus action, meaning that if it's already next to an enemy, it's giving up only one of its two potential attacks. So if the war chief is fighting alongside five or more other orcs, but fewer than ten, it still uses Battle Cry—after it's already charged with the rest of its band."]}}}}},{"name":"Orc Eye of Gruumsh","source":"TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing","_copy":{"name":"Orc Eye of Gruumsh","source":"MM","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":{"type":"entries","name":"Tactics","entries":["Last, there's the orc Eye of Gruumsh, a battlefield cleric. Smarter and wiser than an ordinary orc but not any stronger or tougher, the Eye of Gruumsh is distinguished most by its spellcasting ability. (It also has Gruumsh's Fury, but again, this is a passive trait whose only function is to increase weapon damage—although this makes more of a difference for the Eye of Gruumsh than for the war chief, because the Eye of Gruumsh uses only a spear, not a greataxe.) The variety of spells at its disposal potentially makes the Eye of Gruumsh's combat strategy much more complex, so we need to take a look at the effects and effectiveness of each spell and how it fits into the Eye of Gruumsh's action economy.","One spell stands out: spiritual weapon. Unlike all the Eye of Gruumsh's other spells, this one is cast as a bonus action and, in addition, gives the caster a new bonus action to use every round. This completely changes the Eye of Gruumsh's action economy. The Eye of Gruumsh still charges with all the other orcs, because otherwise, its Aggressive trait would be wasted. But on its second combat round it casts spiritual weapon as a bonus action, and on every subsequent round (up to the spell's 1-minute duration) it continues to use its bonus action, again and again, to attack tougher or harder-to-reach opponents with the Floating Spear of Glowy Force.","The question now is, what does the Eye of Gruumsh do with its action? Spiritual weapon won't require {@status concentration}, so it can start the battle off with a spell that does: bless, guidance, or resistance, of which bless is clearly the strongest. (Which of its companions would the Eye of Gruumsh bless? Orcs aren't exactly altruistic. I'd say it would first take a blessing for itself, then give one to the orc war chief, if there is one, then to any other individual that stands out in the group.)","How about once combat is underway? Augury takes a full minute to cast and has no purpose in combat. Thaumaturgy is interesting, but one has to consider its primary application to be during the parley phase, when the orcs are trying to maximize their fearsomeness. That leaves command.","Command can have a tide-of-battle-swinging effect. One possible beneficial outcome of command is that a PC may be forced into a position that gives opponents advantage on melee attacks. Another is that a PC, ordered to flee, may be subjected to one or more opportunity attacks.","Let's look at what the Eye of Gruumsh gives up by doing this: its Spear action. Against AC 13 (what most orcs are used to, as mentioned above), with +5 to hit, the Eye of Gruumsh has a 65 percent chance of dealing an average of 11 damage, for an expected damage per round of 7. For the Eye of Gruumsh to forgo its Spear action in favor of casting command, the effect of the spell needs to inflict at least 8 expected damage.","As we saw previously, giving an ordinary orc advantage on an attack roll increases its expected damage by about 2. That's not enough for the Eye of Gruumsh to give up its own Spear action. What about an orog? Still not enough: The damage increase is about the same, although it is doubled because of the orog's Multiattack. An orc war chief? Now it starts to get interesting, because the war chief does so much damage with each hit. But the increase in expected damage from attacking with advantage turns out to be surprisingly small: only about 3 per attack, or 6 altogether. And, of course, the Eye of Gruumsh doesn't itself benefit from ordering a foe to grovel, because it gives up one attack action to gain advantage on the next, allowing it one hit at most, rather than two. In addition, we have to remember that the target of a command gets to make a saving throw, so all these gains are attenuated by the probability that the target will shrug it off.","However, what if the Eye of Gruumsh can provoke multiple opportunity attacks on an enemy by ordering them to flee? For starters, opportunity attacks are reactions, meaning we're adding a new element to the action economy. Also, this isn't about the difference between attacking with advantage and attacking without it—it's about the difference between getting an attack and not getting an attack. One orc's expected damage per attack is 6—not as much as the Eye of Gruumsh's expected damage per attack—but two orcs' expected damage is double that, and three orcs' expected damage is triple that, and so on. An orog's expected damage per attack is 7, and an orc war chief's is 10. Command's chance of success is only fifty-fifty even against an average person, so we have to figure that there need to be several orcs on hand to make opportunity attacks for this stunt to be worth trying.","Here's our conclusion: An orc Eye of Gruumsh forgoes its own Spear action in order to cast command against a foe that's within reach of four or more ordinary orcs, or two or more plus a leader. It issues the command \"Scram!\" (equivalent to Flee) in order to provoke an opportunity attack from every orc that can reach the target."]}}}}},{"name":"Gnoll","source":"TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing","_copy":{"name":"Gnoll","source":"MM","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":{"type":"entries","name":"Tactics","entries":["Gnolls are described in the Monster Manual as rapacious raiders, scavengers, and nomads with hyena-like heads.

They wield spears and longbows, according to the Monster Manual, and they have one distinguishing feature, Rampage, which allows them to move half their speed and make a bonus bite attack after reducing a foe to 0 hp in melee.","Honestly, I'd dispense with the longbow—it doesn't make sense in the context of what else the Monster Manual says about gnolls. Their Strength is high enough that they gain little advantage from using one. They aren't smart enough to craft one or social enough to barter for one. According to the flavor text, gnolls prefer to strike at easy targets; longbows are designed to puncture armor. And gnolls' single unique feature is melee-oriented.","So my vision of the gnoll is strictly a hand-to-hand fighter. As creatures with high Strength, high-average Dexterity, average Constitution, and a respectable five hit dice, gnolls are shock troops. When they spot a vulnerable target, most likely during a nighttime patrol ({@sense darkvision} provides advantage on attack rolls against PCs who don't have it), they strike at once. They're fearless and aggressive, using their full movement speed to approach their targets, then attacking with spears; if one such attack reduces an enemy to 0 hp, the gnoll Rampages toward another enemy within 15 feet and bites it (bonus action).","As vicious as they are, however, gnolls are creatures of instinct without ideology, and they place their own survival over such concepts as valor or honor.","If one is seriously wounded (reduced to 8 hp or fewer), it turns tail and flees, using the {@action Dash} action to get away as fast as possible and potentially exposing itself to one or more opportunity attacks in the process."]}}}}},{"name":"Gnoll Pack Lord","source":"TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing","_copy":{"name":"Gnoll Pack Lord","source":"MM","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":{"type":"entries","name":"Tactics","entries":["A pack of gnolls may be led by a gnoll pack lord, which is a more able specimen in every respect, including getting two swings per Multiattack action and having the Incite Rampage feature.

By gnoll standards, this surely qualifies as technological genius.)","Incite Rampage is part of the gnoll pack lord's Multiattack combo, so the gnoll pack lord doesn't have to forgo attacking to use it. Effectively, what Incite Rampage does is grant another gnoll in the pack (a technicality in the wording of Incite Rampage restricts its application to other gnolls, plus giant hyenas, since these are the only creatures with Rampage) the equivalent of an immediate opportunity attack against its opponent.

According to the Monster Manual flavor text, their most salient behavioral trait is their territoriality, followed by their generally acting like South Seas cannibals in a movie from the 1940s. On the flip side, the text does acknowledge that lizardfolk may occasionally form alliances with outsiders, but we'll set that aside, since it's not going to influence their combat tactics.","Lizardfolk, like orcs, are brutes: average Dexterity, high Strength and Constitution. They're also proficient in {@skill Perception} and {@skill Stealth}, and they're more or less amphibious—they can't breathe underwater, but they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes, and they can swim as fast as they can move on land.","Based on this information, the most likely lizardfolk encounter scenario is with a group of scouts patrolling the outskirts of their territory. They'll be alert to intruders—it's why they're out there. Once they notice intruders, they start stalking them (from cover to cover if on land, underwater if in a swamp), until they're close enough to attack. Then they strike first, with surprise if possible.","The lizardfolk's Multiattack action specifies, \"The lizardfolk makes two melee attacks, each one with a different weapon.\" The choices available are Bite, Heavy Club, Javelin, and Spiked Shield. Honestly, the only combinations of these that don't strike me as silly are Heavy Club/Spiked Shield and Javelin/Spiked Shield. The lizardfolk's upright physiology makes the idea of their lunging to bite absurd, let alone lunging to bite in combination with swinging or thrusting a melee weapon. Of course, it's all cosmetic, since every one of the lizardfolk's attacks has the same attack modifier and deals the same damage; the only difference is whether the damage done is bludgeoning (the club) or piercing (everything else), and even that isn't a real difference unless a PC is covered by a magic item or spell that provides resistance to one type of damage and not the other. Let's just say that a lizardfolk's Multiattack action consists of one weapon strike and one shield bash and leave it at that.","Lizardfolk don't have any feature that grants them bonus actions or unique reactions, and their Intelligence is low, so we can assume that they fight like primitives: They pick an enemy, they bash that enemy, and they keep going until the enemy is dead or they're seriously wounded themselves (reduced to 8 hp or fewer). At that point, whether they keep fighting depends entirely on whether or not they're within their own territory. If they are, they keep fighting to the death.","If they're not—if they were scouting beyond their borders, or if they were on a raid—they {@action Dash} back toward their own territory as fast as they can, potentially incurring one or more opportunity attacks. Instinctively, they always attack from the direction of their own territory and position themselves with their backs toward it. They may ambush, but they don't flank.","Long-range weapon attacks confuse them, and magic awes and terrifies them. A lizardfolk shot by an arrow or crossbow bolt instinctively moves in the direction of its territory. (If it's already within its territory, it moves toward the center of that territory.) Depending on the type of spell, the damage it does, whether the lizardfolk can see the caster, and whether they can get to them, they either try to rush the caster or run for their lives. Rushing is more likely if they can see the caster, the spell does no more than light damage (5 or less), and/or there's no other PC in the way. Running is more likely if they can't tell where the spell came from, the spell does serious damage (14 or more), and/or there are too many enemies between themselves and the caster.","Lizardfolk never surrender voluntarily: They assume that they'll be killed. However, lizardfolk who are subdued and captured are impassive about it and will talk to their captors, if any of them speaks Draconic, without sullenness or bluster. That being said, they'll also turn against their captors in a heartbeat if their chances of success look good. An unarmed lizardfolk will bite, as well as grab the nearest handy object to use as an improvised weapon."]}}}}},{"name":"Lizardfolk Shaman","source":"TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing","_copy":{"name":"Lizardfolk Shaman","source":"MM","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":{"type":"entries","name":"Tactics","entries":["A lizardfolk shaman is basically a reskinned druid.

After that, the shaman doesn't enter melee combat—not that it couldn't, being just as strong and tough as any other lizardfolk, but unlike them, it's smart enough to know that if it took a solid hit, its {@status concentration} could be broken, and then there'd go the cobras. Instead, the shaman lobs produce flame cantrips (which do {@damage 2d8} fire damage rather than {@dice 1d8}, because the shaman is a level 5 spellcaster) at any enemies within 30 feet. Its fellow lizardfolk, incidentally, aren't afraid of this magic—on the contrary, since the shaman is on their side, they're feeling extra bold and are much more likely to rush an enemy caster rather than run from them. They'll also become mighty salty if anyone dares to assault their shaman.","Speaking of enemy casters, if one makes the mistake of coming within 30 feet of the lizardfolk shaman, it casts thorn whip and yanks them forward, so that the other lizardfolk can pound them into jelly.","What if the shaman is targeted by a ranged attacker? It's still caught off guard, but its greater mental flexibility allows it to come up with a purposeful response.","If its {@status concentration} isn't broken, it sends a couple of the king cobras (or whatever creatures it summoned) after the PC who shot it. If its {@status concentration} is broken, its main contribution to the battle has just been negated, and until it takes care of that marksman, there's not a lot more that it can do: Most of its spells don't have great range. But since its fellow lizardfolk are useless against ranged attackers, the shaman has to take care of the problem itself. In a swamp, it can Change Shape into crocodile form, submerge, and go after the shooter. In jungle, this won't work, because a crocodile has only 20 feet of movement speed over land, so a marksman can easily keep their distance. The shaman will be forced to conclude that the battle is going south and cast fog cloud, either to cover the lizardfolk's escape (if they're outside their territory) or to enshroud the PCs so that the lizardfolk can reposition themselves more advantageously.","In general, any time a battle outside their territory goes badly for the lizardfolk—say, at least half of them seriously wounded—the lizardfolk shaman casts fog cloud to help them get away. (Inside their territory, the shaman will have already cast fog cloud on the PCs first, to allow the lizardfolk warriors to sneak up on them quickly.) If the fog cloud is dispelled (by gust of wind, say) while the lizardfolk are retreating, the shaman will follow up with plant growth to slow their pursuers even further. (What about entangle and spike growth? Their utility diminishes significantly in a swamp or jungle, where the terrain is already difficult. And the fact that they also require {@status concentration} forces a choice between one of them and conjure animals or fog cloud, which are clearly superior.)"]}}}}},{"name":"Lizard King/Queen","source":"TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing","_copy":{"name":"Lizard King","source":"MM","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":{"type":"entries","name":"Tactics","entries":["The lizard king/queen isn't complicated at all.

This implication is emphasized further by their proficiency in {@skill Deception} and {@skill Stealth}. They have {@sense darkvision}, suggesting that they're most at home in dim places and/or most active at night. Along with suggestion, they can cast the cantrip poison spray three times per day at its base damage level of {@dice 1d12} (I like to imagine that they spit it from their mouths). They can also cast animal friendship on snakes, for whatever that's worth.","According to the Monster Manual flavor text, yuan-ti purebloods often put on cloaks and try to pass for human in order to \"kidnap prisoners for interrogation and sacrifice,\" so let's start with that: The yuan-ti wants to kill you, but it doesn't want to kill you right here and now. Instead, it wants to get you someplace where it can kill you in a way that makes its gods happy.","Therefore, a yuan-ti pureblood encounter is going to begin with the yuan-ti cloaked and hooded, using {@skill Deception} to hide what they are, and casting suggestion as soon as the player characters approach within 30 feet, saying something along the lines of \"This is a dangerous place, and you look like you could use some extra help. Come with us.\" I'd say that their moderately high Intelligence combined with the fact that this is an innate ability lets them \"read\" the PCs to pick out which ones have the lowest Wisdom saving throws and therefore will be most susceptible. Remember that a single yuan-ti can target only a single PC at once with this ability; if you want to charm more PCs, you need more yuan-ti.","If the suggestion succeeds, they'll take the PCs back to their settlement, overwhelm the PCs with numbers and grappling attacks, and prep for their sacrificial ceremony. If it fails, the PCs will undoubtedly attack, and if they don't, the yuan-ti will.","Yuan-ti purebloods are competent, though unexceptional, at both melee and ranged combat. In melee, they have Multiattack, letting them attack twice per turn with their scimitars. At range, they have only one shot per action, but their arrows are {@condition poisoned}, which makes ranged attacks marginally better, though not enough to make a meaningful difference. Thus, whether they opt for melee or ranged combat depends in large part on where they are when combat begins. If they're in the thick of things, they choose melee; if they're at a distance, they choose ranged; and they pretty much stay wherever they are unless they're forced to flee. Poison spray doesn't offer them any real advantage over either a scimitar or a shortbow, unless they're disarmed somehow.","Yuan-ti have had hundreds of generations to live and adapt on their own, so they'll have the same self-preservation instinct as any evolved species.

All three types have high Charisma and Intelligence and also high Strength and Dexterity, making them good commanders and shock troops. They can also Shapechange back and forth between their yuan-ti form and a Medium-size snake form; their equipment doesn't change with them, however.","As a snake, a yuan-ti malison gets one Bite attack per action, doing {@damage 1d4 + 3} piercing damage plus {@damage 2d6} poison damage. In contrast, a type 1 or type 3 yuan-ti malison can attack twice with its scimitar, doing {@dice 1d6 + 3} on each hit for about the same total damage, or twice with its longbow, doing {@damage 1d8 + 2} piercing damage plus {@damage 2d6} poison damage on each hit, for roughly twice the damage. I know which one I'd choose. Changing into snake form offers the yuan-ti malison no combat advantage at all, except—implicitly—immunity to the {@condition prone} condition (the stat block doesn't say this explicitly, but think about it for a second), and it comes with the disadvantage of divesting it of its weapons. I'd say this is a dubiously useful ability at best, and I wouldn't have a yuan-ti malison Shapechange during combat, except maybe to escape through a tiny hole.","One of the things I like about the type 3 yuan-ti malison is that it has the extra attacking feature Constrict, which does {@damage 2d6 + 3} bludgeoning damage and grapples its target, restraining it as well. Moreover, since it's grappling with its lower body, its hands are still free. That means that on its next turn, it can take two scimitar swings with advantage. I love both the tactical elegance of this combination and the visual image of it. Type 1 and type 2 don't offer anything of the kind. Plus, the idea of a person with snakes for arms—each with its own head—strikes me as goofy rather than horrifying.","Say you've got a party of four PCs, encountering a group of five yuan-ti: three purebloods and two type 3 malisons. The malisons hide 120 feet away from the purebloods, while the purebloods use suggestion to charm the PCs. If a pureblood's suggestion fails or is broken, it draws its scimitar and attacks with it. On cue, the malisons begin sniping at the PCs, targeting elves, gnomes, barbarians, and paladins first. (Why on earth these categories? Because they have the best resistance against being {@condition charmed}.) Once all the purebloods are moderately wounded or any one of them is seriously wounded, the malisons then {@action Dash} in to fight hand-to-hand. They begin with a Multiattack comprising an attempt to Constrict followed by a Scimitar attack. As long as their targets remain {@condition grappled}, they'll keep Multiattacking with their scimitars; if a target breaks free, they'll try to Constrict again.

Why would they cast that, though? They're havoc in battle: Once they grapple an enemy, they can take three scimitar swings with advantage and +7 to hit. (That's an 88 percent chance to hit against AC 15.) Whether they're attacking at range with longbows or in melee with scimitars, they do nearly double the malison's damage.","There are only two reasons why a yuan-ti abomination would opt for fear over simply beating the tar out of its opponents: Either it's protecting some kind of sacred or otherwise important place, and keeping trespassers away is its foremost priority; or its opponents are tougher than it bargained for, and it's losing the fight.","In the former case—that is, when the yuan-ti abomination is more interested in driving the PCs away than in murdering them—it casts fear at the very beginning of the encounter, then fights those too stubborn to go away. In the latter case, it casts fear when it's moderately injured (reduced to 88 hp or fewer), in order to reduce the number of enemies that it and its allies have to deal with right away, and if it's seriously injured (reduced to 50 hp or fewer), it Disengages and attempts to retreat.","A yuan-ti abomination fighting to protect a place of importance does so fanatically.

The Monster Manual flavor text describes them as \"struck with a deep inferiority complex... desperately crav[ing] the fear and respect of outsiders\" and says they'll generally prefer to capture trespassers rather than kill them outright, hauling them back to win favor with their rulers first. One way they do this is by taming giant frogs and having them swallow victims whole; however, this works only on Small or Tiny targets, meaning that unless a party of PCs is made up entirely of halflings and gnomes, this isn't a strategy they can rely on in a typical encounter.","For creatures with only two hit dice, bullywugs aren't too shabby in combat. All their physical abilities are modestly above average, and they have proficiency in {@skill Stealth} and the Swamp Camouflage trait, which grants them advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks in swampy terrain. It's fair to say, therefore, that bullywugs won't venture outside such areas—not when they have such a natural advantage on their home turf.","Moreover, their Standing Leap ability lets them move their full speed of 20 feet per turn as a long jump, when the jumping rule would normally allow them to leap only 6 feet. This allows them to cover distance in difficult marshy terrain without having to halve their movement speed. If you want to be nitpicky about it, you can require them to succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check when they land, per \"Special Types of Movement: Jumping\" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook, but personally, I'd say that bullywugs, whose natural habitat is the swamp, shouldn't have to make that check when landing. And for the sake of flavor, I like the idea of having bullywugs bouncing around like a bunch of ornery little Superballs during combat rather than trudging around in 2-D as we landbound humanoids must. (Mind you, this doesn't exempt them from opportunity attacks when they jump out of PCs' reach.)","Okay, so far we've established that bullywug encounters will occur in swamps. Let's also stipulate, based on the aforementioned features, that their favored strategy is ambush (their physical abilities don't indicate a preference for one form of combat over another, but their features do). Now let's add, based on their 40- foot swimming speed, that they prefer combat to take place near open water: This is their favored method of escape. From the bullywugs' point of view, the ideal ambush location is on ground solid enough to fight on but also near water deep enough to swim in. They're Medium creatures, so this depth will be at least 3 feet.","Wanting, ideally, to capture rather than kill, bullywugs attack in numbers large enough to surround and overwhelm a party of adventurers—let's say three to one. But here's a question: If you can get a free attack by popping out of hiding and surprising your enemies, will you really forgo that attack and demand their surrender when it costs you the benefit of surprise if they decide to fight back? Bullywugs aren't bright, but I think even they can grasp what the whole point of an ambush is. They'll take that surprise attack, thank you, and with any luck, the damage they do in the first round will serve as further incentive to stand down. If that damage should happen, by some fluke, to knock a target out, they'll make it nonlethal.","So here's what round 1 looks like: The bullywugs lie in wait, hidden, at a range of 15 to 20 feet from where they expect the PCs to pass. At the right moment, they spring out of hiding, land next to the PCs, and kick off melee combat with surprise, spearing and biting. In round 2, they keep attacking while demanding the PCs' surrender—in Bullywug, because they're too dumb to realize that the PCs don't speak Bullywug. In round 3, they also keep attacking and demanding the PCs' surrender, still in Bullywug but louder and more slowly. If any PC gets the message and drops their weapon, the nearest bullywug will grab and grapple that PC and pull them away from the fight, rifling through their pockets and pouches for anything valuable.","Bullywugs are cowards. If one is moderately wounded (reduced to 7 hp or fewer), it will leap away, but it won't flee just yet—it will look for an opportunity to get back in the fight alongside a couple of less wounded allies, and in the meantime, it Hides and repositions. However, a seriously injured bullywug (reduced to 4 hp or fewer) will indeed flee, using the {@action Dash} action to double its movement speed, leaping into the nearest water deep enough to swim in (and possibly incurring one or more opportunity attacks), then swimming away. If no water of sufficient depth is near enough, it simply leaps twice, 20 feet each time. Bullywugs also flee when their numbers are reduced to fewer than one-and-a-half the number of PCs, then attempt to regroup with other bullywugs in the area, stalk the PCs, and attack again when the opportunity presents itself."]}}}}},{"name":"Kuo-toa","source":"TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing","_copy":{"name":"Kuo-toa","source":"MM","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":{"type":"entries","name":"Tactics","entries":["The basic kuo-toa stat block has high Strength but average Dexterity and Constitution, and it lacks proficiency in {@skill Stealth}.

A Net attack restrains an opponent, giving the kuo-toa advantage on attack rolls and giving the opponent disadvantage. However, because of their extremely short range, solo Net attacks always have disadvantage. Also, the net is effortless to escape from, so there need to be a second, third, and fourth kuo-toa on hand to throw more nets, ensuring a reasonable chance that a target will be trapped under at least two. Since a target can escape from only one net at a time, this guarantees that they'll remain {@condition restrained}.","What this tells us is that kuo-toa don't attack without a four-to-one numerical advantage or better, throwing nets until a target is covered by two, then attacking with advantage using the Spear action. If you're using the optional Flanking rule (Dungeon Master's Guide, chapter 8), you can get away with a two-to-one advantage: Once the target is under a single net, the battle buddies quickly get on either side of them in order to maintain their advantage in case the captive wriggles free, then begin stabbing.","Kuo-toa can breathe underwater, from which we can infer another possible tactic: hauling enemies into the water and trying to drown them. Assuming that the kuo-toa double-team their foes, one grappling and the other taking the {@action Help} action to confer advantage on the check, the grapple-and-drown tactic is reasonable against opponents whose Strength ({@skill Athletics}) and Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) modifiers are both +4 or lower; to have any real confidence of success, they both need to be +1 or lower. If there are more kuo-toa on hand, they can throw nets before grappling; this doesn't impose disadvantage on rolls to escape a grapple, but it overwhelms the target, giving them too many things they have to escape from. Once a target is both {@condition restrained} and {@condition grappled}, any remaining kuo-toa stab.","Kuo-toa can't read PCs' stats. They can only know from experience whether a tactic generally works or generally doesn't, and what experience tells them is that it's possible for two of them to drown one average or punier-than-average humanoid, but against a big or brawny one, it doesn't usually work.","The Sticky Shield reaction gives the kuo-toa a chance to disable an opponent's weapon. It's only usable in melee. Therefore, kuo-toa prefer melee over ranged combat and close to melee range as soon as they've thrown their nets. (The Monster Manual indicates that monsters with throwable weapons can be assumed to carry {@dice 2d4} of them, but nets are big and bulky. I wouldn't give a single kuo-toa more than one.)","If nets and grappling clearly aren't getting the desired result but the kuo-toa still outnumber their opponents at least three to one, they'll switch to attacking with Spear alone, to maximize damage. This is the full extent of their ability to adapt. If they no longer have the numbers, they {@action Dash} away (through water, if possible). They also have a normal self-preservation instinct and {@action Dash} away when seriously injured (7 hp or fewer)."]}}}}},{"name":"Kuo-toa Whip","source":"TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing","_copy":{"name":"Kuo-toa Whip","source":"MM","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":{"type":"entries","name":"Tactics","entries":["The kuo-toa whip is actually a clerical spellcaster, not (as one might reasonably think) a kuo-toa with a whip.

The execution of this tactic depends on which has higher initiative, the whip or its kuo-toa allies.

This is where their habitations are and where they're most likely to be encountered. With a 40-foot swimming speed and only a 10-foot land speed, getting into a scrap on dry land is a very bad proposition for merfolk. Underwater, their swimming speed is a huge advantage against any creature not native to the depths.","Although their ability scores all fall into a typical humanoid range, they do have above-average Dexterity and Constitution, and these, combined with their swimming speed, bias them toward a skirmish style of combat. Since the spears they carry can be thrown underwater at normal range without disadvantage, part of a group of merfolk can engage in melee while others throw their spears; some may even do both.","It's worth a closer examination to see just how big an advantage their swimming speed is for them. For a character who isn't innately aquatic or buffed by a magic item, every foot swum costs an extra foot of movement, effectively halving movement speed in most cases. This means that Silvio the Swordsman is slowed to 15 feet per round underwater, whereas his merfolk opponent can swim 40 feet per round.","How do they use this to gain an even greater advantage? Mainly, by goading opponents into splitting up. Rather than coalesce around a melee front line, merfolk initiate combat by throwing spears from a distance of exactly 20 feet—no more, no less—from all sides of their foes, if possible. If they're on defense and can attack from only one side, they form a line, from which the ones on the ends spread out while the ones in the center fall back, eventually forming a semicircle around their opponents. (Because underwater combat takes place in three dimensions, some can also go up or down.)","As they encircle (or en-semicircle, or en-hemisphere) their enemies, they fall back as those enemies advance, maintaining that 20-foot distance. If an enemy does manage to close the distance with a merfolk, it stops throwing spears and starts stabbing with one instead; ditto if the merfolk have managed to lure their foes into spreading out 30 feet or more from one another, or if the withdrawing merfolk is down to its last spear. It's only practical to carry so many spears—three or four is probably the limit—and a merfolk never throws its last one. A seriously wounded merfolk (reduced to 4 hp or fewer), or one forcibly disarmed of its last spear, Disengages and retreats. If reinforcements are available, it then Dashes off to fetch them.","Against a party of low-level adventurers, {@footnote as many as five merfolk to one PC constitute a winnable fight (although two to one is fairer for novice adventurers just starting out)|According to \"Creating a Combat Encounter\" in chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, these merfolk-to-PC ratios constitute Deadly encounters. However, according to the alternative guidelines under \"Encounter Building\" in chapter 2 of Xanathar's Guide to Everything, they produce a balanced encounter. I ran a test scenario comprising ten merfolk against five level 1 PCs with water breathing cast upon them, which ended in the merfolk's being routed with only two PCs wounded. I conclude that Xanathar's is right.}, so there should always be plenty of merfolk on hand to allow some to fight hand-to-hand, some to throw spears, and some to retreat.","Merfolk are neutral, not evil, which means their initial disposition toward strangers is indifference rather than hostility. They are cautious, however, and order any strangers who approach to between 20 and 60 feet to halt and state their business. If they're not satisfied by the reply they receive (they don't take \"Blurrrbbblllpp!\" for an answer), they cock their spears as a warning. But they don't attack unless and until their visitors take action that could be reasonably interpreted as hostile, and they won't chase down fleeing foes."]}}}}},{"name":"Sahuagin","source":"TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing","_copy":{"name":"Sahuagin","source":"MM","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":{"type":"entries","name":"Tactics","entries":["Sahuagin are fierce amphibious fish-people who live underwater but emerge periodically to raid coastal settlements. Although the Monster Manual says they \"dwell in the deepest trenches of the ocean,\" that's a bit far even for a creature with a 40-foot swimming speed. Those ocean trenches are as far from the coasts as the highest mountains are, and you don't often hear about the yetis of the Himalayas spending an afternoon staging a raid on Kolkata, or the Tatzelwürmer of the Alps popping down to Genoa for some late-night ravaging. These are distances of hundreds of miles we're talking about. So chances are, any sahuagin that PCs encounter are going to be denizens of shallower depths. Maybe they're the border reivers of the ocean kingdom.","When they come ashore to raid, they do so at night, as implied by their 120 feet of {@sense darkvision} (which also helps them see deep underwater). They can't come far inland, since their Limited Amphibiousness gives them only four hours of air breathing before they have to return to the water. Unlike, say, merrows, sahuagin can move about on land as easily as any other humanoid.","In this environment, they're basic brutes. Their Multiattack gives them one Spear or Claw attack and one Bite attack. Since their Armor Class doesn't include a shield, we can presume that they wield their spears two-handed for the greater damage.","Because their Blood Frenzy trait gives them advantage on attacks against any opponent who's taken damage already, they'll press this advantage, continuing to attack any enemy they've bloodied rather than switch targets, even for opportunistic reasons.","However, sahuagin are not dumb. In fact, their Intelligence and Wisdom are higher than those of the average humanoid. They attack with discipline, in cohesive units, perhaps even splitting up to flank or encircle a group of enemies.","They'll realize quickly when they're outmatched, retreating if all the members of their fighting group are moderately wounded (reduced to 15 hp or fewer) and their enemies aren't hurt even worse. When they come ashore, they're looking for an easy fight. A hard one isn't worth the effort.

Thanks to the Shark Telepathy trait, any sharks fighting alongside sahuagin will show the same intelligence and discipline that the sahuagin possess.","Second, being naturally aquatic, they can easily recognize when other creatures aren't naturally aquatic. They're smart enough to know that a halfling isn't a sea creature, and therefore, if it's breathing underwater and swimming as if born to it, there's some kind of magic giving it that ability. Once they see a player character cast a spell, they'll draw the logical (though not necessarily correct) conclusion that that same PC is the one enabling their allies to breathe, and they'll focus their attacks on that PC. If they subsequently see a different PC cast a spell, some of them will break off to attack them as well. (They may or may not be aware that water breathing isn't a spell that requires {@status concentration}. If they are aware of this, they'll fixate less on hunting spellcasters, since they'll know that killing the caster won't break the spell.)","Sahuagin in the water are also more tenacious than sahuagin on land. When fighting underwater, they'll hang in there until a majority of them are seriously wounded (reduced to 8 hp or fewer).

Their ability scores are unremarkable overall, except for their high Dexterity, which serves as both their primary offensive and primary defensive ability. Since their ranged attacking ability is limited to throwing javelins and their Dive Attack trait works only with melee attacks, aarakocra are primarily shock attackers that strike from above. With their expertise in {@skill Perception}, they make great scouts, and when fighting alongside PCs, they'll volunteer to act as scouts and strike at enemies who are attempting to hide.","Aarakocra strategy revolves around two things: getting the best use out of their Dive Attack and staying out of reach until they're ready to strike. Thus, if they observe that their enemies have missile or throwable weapons, they keep to an altitude just out of those weapons' normal range until they're close enough to dive; they also use tree canopies as cover, where available, since it's the only cover they're likely to be able to take advantage of. While scouting, they use the {@action Search} action if their passive {@skill Perception} isn't high enough to spot a target, then switch to {@action Dodge} once they've found one and are closing in. Against enemies without ranged attack capability, they maintain a cruising altitude of 30 feet while Searching and Dodging; against other fliers, it's a dance in which the Dodging aarakocra try to goad their foes into approaching to a distance of 30 to 50 feet.","That range is the sweet spot for a Dive Attack, against either a ground-bound or an aerial enemy. (Reduce the upper bound a bit for aarakocra diving through a tree canopy, which must constitute difficult terrain for a flying creature.) As soon as an aarakocra can reach an enemy in a single round's flying movement, it dives and strikes, gaining an extra damage die thanks to Dive Attack. The Javelin action is preferred over the Talon action, just because the average damage is slightly better.","What happens next depends on the kind of society your aarakocra belong to. If it's larger and more organized than a simple band or tribe, at least the size and complexity of a chiefdom (see \"Tribal Warriors and Berserkers,\" page 110), they may belong to a trained warrior class, in which case they'll know how to {@action Disengage}. If so, then after striking once with Dive Attack, their next action will be to {@action Disengage} and fly back up into the air, setting up for another Dive Attack on the following turn. If they're not trained warriors, then once they've closed with an enemy, they won't have much choice but to try to finish the fight in melee. Without Flyby or an equivalent trait, trying to get airborne again for another Dive Attack would invite an opportunity strike, and their Armor Class and hit points aren't good enough for them to risk that.","Aarakocra attacking foes that lack ranged attacks, or that wield only throwable weapons, slings, hand crossbows, or other missiles with very short range, may spend one or more rounds flying down to a height of 30 feet, throwing a javelin, then flying back up out of reach again until their foes are seriously wounded (reduced to 40 percent or less of their hit point maximum). At this point they finally use their Dive Attack to try to finish their enemies off. Both trained and untrained aarakocra may employ this tactic, which deals slightly more damage, on average, than making Dive Attacks on alternate turns—although it's limited by the number of javelins the aarakocra carry. An aarakocra never throws its last javelin unless it's retreating.","In short, against enemies with good ranged attacks, aarakocra emphasize melee fighting, and against enemies without good ranged attacks, aarakocra emphasize ranged attacks of their own. They Dive Attack to avoid incoming missiles, against seriously injured enemies, or when they're down to their last javelin. Otherwise, they do their best to stay out of reach.","Untrained aarakocra retreat from melee, using just their normal flying movement, when they're moderately wounded (reduced to 9 hp or fewer), but they'll continue throwing javelins, if it makes sense to do so, until they're seriously wounded (reduced to 5 hp or fewer). Trained aarakocra continue fighting until they're seriously wounded, then fly off to a safe distance as fast as they can.

(In any thri-kreen encounter, it's good to have the thri-kreen slightly outnumber their opponents in order to allow a few to dart from opponent to opponent.)","Because magic weapon is no good without a weapon to enchant, psionic thrikreen will usually also be weapon-wielding thri-kreen themselves or accompanied by weapon-wielding thri-kreen; otherwise, they'll never get to use their ability to cast magic weapon, which seems like a waste. Psionic thri-kreen engaged with the toughest of their opponents use invisibility to vanish and relocate when they take a particularly serious hit (one dealing 10 damage or more). Once they've used this once-per-day ability, they cast blur upon re-manifesting, giving their opponents the same penalty against them as if they were {@condition invisible}. Thri-kreen cast magic weapon on their polearms, not on their chatkchas, which are single-use."]}}}}},{"name":"Werewolf","source":"TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing","_copy":{"name":"Werewolf","source":"MM","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":{"type":"entries","name":"Tactics","entries":["Werewolves in their hybrid form lack any ranged attack, so they're strictly melee fighters.

(Stat blocks aren't written in stone, though. If you want your werewolves to have {@sense darkvision}, give them {@sense darkvision}. Wolves are nocturnal, for pity's sake.)","Their immunity to normal weapons makes them unafraid of opportunity attacks, generally speaking, and as predators, they prefer easy prey to hard prey. Consequently, they attack the weakest first (in a village, that means commoners, not seasoned adventurers), and if struck by a ranged weapon attack or spell attack that does no damage or insignificant damage (5 or less), they immediately {@action Dash} out of sight, thereafter to {@action Hide} again and resume stalking prey. However, if a PC aims a melee attack at a werewolf and either misses or does no damage or insignificant damage, the werewolf counterattacks against that PC, clawing and biting. A werewolf struck for 6 or more damage by a spell attack or a magic or silvered weapon, either melee or ranged, flees using the {@action Dash} action.","Werewolves in their hybrid form can speak and understand speech, but they generally don't have much to say. When slain, they return to human form, and I like to use this moment to deliver the players an extra punch in the feels—for instance, by having a group of three slain werewolves revert to the forms of two young women and a teenage boy, who all bear a strong family resemblance to one another."]}}}}},{"name":"Wererat","source":"TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing","_copy":{"name":"Wererat","source":"MM","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":{"type":"entries","name":"Tactics","entries":["Werewolves are most likely to be found in country villages; wererats are urban creatures.

They'll attack victims whom they outnumber at least two to one, sniping with their hand crossbows from hiding, from behind cover, and from multiple directions. Their overall strategy is to wear down, then close in when all their victims are seriously wounded (reduced to 40 percent of their hit point maximum or less—calculate this threshold for your PCs before the session). If a wererat's target charges and engages it in melee, it fights back fearlessly with its shortsword and its teeth, unless and until it's struck by a magic or silvered weapon or a spell attack. In that case, it Dashes into the shadows. Once other wererats realize that their fellows are being driven off by magical attacks or silver weapons, they too break off attack and withdraw.","That's not necessarily the end of it, though. The PCs may decide to give chase—at night, through the streets and alleys and shadows, which means that while fortune may have turned momentarily against the wererats, they still have the home field advantage. They'll scatter, but they won't go far, and once one finds an advantageous hiding place, it Readies a Hand Crossbow attack, shooting a bolt at any PC who passes before it—if there are multiple targets, favoring one carrying a magic or silvered weapon or casting injurious spells.

(Male tigers both hunt and lair alone.) Therefore, an encounter with a weretiger generally involves a single individual, unless the party has stumbled upon a lair belonging to a group of females or a female with offspring. Even so, this group won't be large.","Weretigers keep to remote areas and generally don't hunt humanoids; a weretiger that does is an exception to the rule, and this may be why the PCs are fighting it in the first place. It would also be a reasonable justification for having the weretiger fight in hybrid form, since according to the Monster Manual flavor text, weretigers generally prefer to keep to human form; using the hybrid form will highlight its deviant nature.","Weretigers have {@sense darkvision} in all their forms and proficiency in {@skill Stealth}, so these are nocturnal ambush hunters. Their Pounce feature is similar to a Charge but with the addition of a bonus Bite attack. They can wield longbows, but I think this is something that ordinary weretigers would use to defend their territory; a rogue weretiger would favor the potent melee combo offered by the Pounce feature.","Therefore the rogue weretiger (not to be confused with a weretiger rogue) stalks its prey from hiding, then Pounces with surprise. What does it consider prey? Probably not a whole party of well-armed adventurers—but then again, weretigers have only average Intelligence, so one may underestimate a group of PCs who aren't flaunting their accomplishments. Still, while a weretiger won't hesitate to attack a single PC and probably wouldn't balk at two, a group of three, four, or five is another matter: They'd have to be weak, or at least weakened, or the weretiger would have to possess some sort of situational advantage, beyond mere darkness. It won't touch a group of six or more, period.","Using the Pounce action in its surprise round, the weretiger gets 15 to 30 feet of movement, a Multiattack action comprising two Claw attacks, and a Bite attack as a bonus action. After that, is there any reason for the weretiger to bother drawing a scimitar and slashing away? Nah. As long as it's engaged in melee, it continues to use its Claw/Claw Multiattack.","Like other werebeasts, a weretiger knows that magic and silvered weapons can hurt or kill it, as can spells, and it will withdraw quickly when moderately injured (reduced to 84 or fewer hp), because anything that can deal a moderate wound to a weretiger can probably do worse as well. It Dashes away, then Hides as soon as the PCs lose sight of it. But as with wererats, the encounter probably won't end there, because the PCs will have been hunting the weretiger in the first place. As much as it can, it will use {@skill Stealth} to avoid them and will fight back only against a single PC if the party splits up.","But suppose it's not a rogue weretiger we're talking about—suppose it's a regular, I-just-wanna-be-left-alone weretiger that the PCs are hunting? According to the Monster Manual flavor text, this kind of weretiger will prefer to keep to its humanoid form whenever it can, and in that form, it will prefer to hide and not be found. It won't even counterattack from hiding with its bow, because that would give away its position. It simply Hides and stays hidden until the PCs go away. If the PCs get too close—say, within bowshot range—this is the rare instance in which it makes sense for the weretiger to Shapechange from humanoid to tiger form, because in this form, it has a movement speed of 40 feet and thus can more easily run away.

Rather than humanoids tainted with a bestial curse, they're jackals tainted with a human curse. Like lycanthropes, however, they typically adopt a hybrid form during combat.","Jackalweres have an unusual ability contour: high Dexterity but merely average Strength and Constitution, combined with above-average Intelligence. This is a contour usually associated with a sniper or a spellcaster, but jackalweres' attacks are largely melee-based. This suggests three things. First, jackalweres are shock attackers, not well suited to drawn-out combat, and will abandon a fight quickly if they don't immediately get the upper hand. Second, they rely heavily on guile. And third, the successful use of their Sleep Gaze feature—the closest thing they have to spellcasting—figures prominently in their strategy.","Jackalweres are proficient in {@skill Deception} and {@skill Stealth}—here's the guile, as well as a potential way to strike with surprise. They're immune to physical damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, giving them a little more staying power than they'd have otherwise. Since they have only 18 hp to begin with, though, that's not saying a lot. They have the Pack Tactics trait, which suggests that another key part of their strategy is not starting fights at all unless they outnumber their victims substantially. (The Monster Manual flavor text notes that they often have ordinary jackals fighting alongside them, but these pose little or no threat to intermediate- or higher-level adventurers.)","Sleep Gaze is weak, as monster features go. All it takes to resist is a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. The average adventurer has a 60 percent chance of succeeding on that roll; the average cleric, druid, paladin, warlock, or wizard, as well as any gnome, a 75 percent or better chance; and Fey Ancestry makes elves entirely immune to it. But that assumes one jackalwere and one target. Two jackalweres against one target... well, that's like giving the target disadvantage on the roll, reducing their chances of success to 36 or 56 percent (elves remain immune). How about three against one? Chances reduced to 22 and 42 percent. Four against one, 13 and 32 percent. (Note, as usual, the careful and highly literal phrasing of the feature: \"A creature that successfully saves against the effect is immune to this jackalwere's gaze for the next 24 hours\"—emphasis mine. Not any jackalwere's gaze, just this jackalwere's.)","Unlike a lot of monsters, jackalweres are intelligent—crafty, even. They may not be able to judge how experienced a PC is, but they can tell whether one is carrying a holy symbol or a staff, and they know that means they'll probably be a harder target. They also know that gnomes are resistant to their special ability and that elves are immune to it.","Their goal is to end the fight in the first round if they can. Thus, for jackalweres to initiate an encounter, their numbers must total the following: three per elf (to kill them), four per gnome or non-elf who displays a holy symbol or wields a staff (to overwhelm their resistance to Sleep Gaze), and two per other non-gnome/non-elf (ditto).","As an example, let's look at a six-character party I ran a campaign for. It consisted of a human barbarian, a halfling ranger/rogue, a dwarf ranger, a human paladin, an elf sorcerer, and a dwarf druid. A pack of jackalweres would have to number at least seventeen to be willing to attack this party. Two of them would use Sleep Gaze against the barbarian, two against the halfling, two against the dwarf ranger, four against the paladin, and four against the druid; the remaining three would draw scimitars and attack the elf sorcerer directly, using Pack Tactics to gain advantage on their attack rolls.","That's in the first round of combat. In the second, Sleep Gaze won't work anymore, because any foe who's still awake will have saved successfully against each of their assailants. On the other hand, any victims of the jackalweres who haven't been put to sleep will be greatly outnumbered, and all the attacking jackalweres will gain advantage from Pack Tactics. If a third round of combat isn't enough for them to subdue all their foes, they'll all {@action Disengage} and run away in the fourth round.","\"Jackalweres kidnap humanoids for their lamia masters,\" the flavor text informs us. \"A jackalwere's magical gaze renders a foe {@condition unconscious}, allowing the monster to bind a creature or drag it away.\" What if a pack of jackalweres aren't working for a lamia? They're gonna eat you, son. They're chaotic evil. Once a target is {@condition unconscious}, jackalweres lower their blades and switch to Bite attacks—which do critical damage against {@condition unconscious} targets.","Because jackalweres won't fight without an overwhelming numerical advantage, think very carefully about pitting low-level PCs against them if they're hunting independently (as opposed to seeking captives for a boss lamia). Up to about level 4, any number of jackalweres willing to tangle with your PCs will be too many for them to handle. The sweet spot at which they'll be an appropriate challenge for your PCs is level 5. At level 6 or 7, they'll be a serious threat only as minions fighting alongside a lamia. At level 8 or above, you can safely play them for comedy.","An individual jackalwere that's seriously injured (reduced to 7 hp or fewer) will first {@action Disengage}, then Dash away. If at least half of a jackalwere pack has fled or been slain, the rest {@action Dash} away without bothering to {@action Disengage}. If a party of adventurers initiates combat against them—most likely, by catching them off guard—and they lack the numbers they'd need to start a fight themselves, they don't stand their ground. Instead, they immediately {@action Dash} and flee."]}}}}},{"name":"Drow","source":"TheMonstersKnowWhatTheyreDoing","_copy":{"name":"Drow","source":"MM","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":{"type":"entries","name":"Tactics","entries":["The basic drow in the Monster Manual is stronger, across the board, than a nonplayer character commoner with drow racial traits applied. So let's say that this drow is something more akin to a drow guard—a trained, regular fighter or scout.","Dexterity is the drow's highest stat, followed by Charisma. Its Strength and Constitution are average, its Intelligence and Wisdom only marginally higher (not enough even to get a plus to their modifiers). This is the profile of a sniper. Drow are armed with both shortswords (thrusting weapons akin to an ancient Greek xiphos) and hand crossbows, but their lower Constitution relative to their Dexterity strongly suggests a preference for the ranged weapon over the melee weapon. They have proficiency in {@skill Stealth}, marking them as ambush fighters.","They also have the innate ability to cast dancing lights at will and darkness and faerie fire once per day each. The combination of double-range {@sense darkvision} and Sunlight Sensitivity implies a creature that not only gets around well in darkness but is averse to light, so why would a drow want to cast dancing lights or faerie fire?","The answer is that the ideal illumination for a creature with {@sense darkvision} isn't total darkness but rather dim light (if it really preferred total darkness, it would have {@sense blindsight}). Dancing lights and faerie fire shed dim light, not bright light, which is perfect.","Meanwhile, darkness fills a 15-foot-radius sphere (engulfing three creatures on average, again per the Targets in Area of Effect table) with magical darkness that blinds even creatures with {@sense darkvision}. Only magical light can penetrate it, but it has to be magical light shed by a spell of 3rd level or higher. The drow's dancing lights and faerie fire aren't enough: The darkness will swallow them up. This spell seems to be useful only as a way of temporarily debilitating enemies, particularly spellcasters who need to be able to see their targets.","Drow never fight aboveground in daylight. Only in the rarest instances—and out of necessity—do they venture aboveground in daylight at all.","All drow stat blocks include some form of poison. In the basic drow stat block, this poison requires a DC 13 Constitution save and imposes the {@condition poisoned} condition, along with the {@condition unconscious} condition if the target fails their saving throw by 5 or more. Referring to \"Poisons\" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, this is \"drow poison,\" which the drow manufacture themselves, so it stands to reason that they'd use it routinely. The drow's hand crossbow bolts are {@condition poisoned}, but the shortsword isn't—yet another reason to assume they prefer sniping over melee.","Incidentally, since dwarves are resistant to poison (and also happen to be their number one competitors for the best underground real estate), it stands to reason that drow would find dwarves' presence particularly irritating, possibly enough to focus their attacks on them.","So here's our profile of drow combat: They patrol their caverns in darkness, using {@skill Stealth}. They can detect enemies up to 120 feet away. When enemies come near, they fan out and {@action Hide}. When the player characters wander into their midst, one drow in the patrol (or two, if one isn't enough) casts faerie fire to illuminate the interlopers, whereupon the rest attack with surprise, using their {@condition poisoned} hand crossbows, and paying special attention to any dwarf in the party. Between the subterranean darkness and the drow poison, once the PCs get their chance to act in the subsequent round, many of them will have disadvantage on their attack rolls, while the drow will have advantage—an advantage they'll retain even if the PCs fire up torches, lanterns, or light spells, thanks to faerie fire.","Being accustomed to underground combat, the drow will notice when one of their targets is trying to hide, and if that target isn't already lit up with faerie fire, the nearest drow will cast dancing lights to \"chase\" that PC with dim light, so that the drow don't suffer disadvantage on their {@skill Perception} checks to contest the character's {@skill Stealth}. Because the spell creates four independently movable lights, the pursuit doesn't have to be exact, and the drow can illuminate a wide swath around wherever the PC is likely to be hiding. On the flip side, if a spellcaster is causing persistent problems for the drow, and it's far enough away from the nonspellcasting PCs, the nearest one will drop a darkness sphere on it.","Drow may or may not take prisoners, but they are absolutely unwilling to be taken prisoner. Most will fight to the death, some will {@action Dash} away if seriously wounded (reduced to 6 hp or fewer), but none will ever surrender."]}}}}}]}
