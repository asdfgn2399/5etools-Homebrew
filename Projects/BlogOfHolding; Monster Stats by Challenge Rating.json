Damage budget: 25 (25% high): Fireball 1/day (28 damage, costing 14 points of the damage budget); Fire Blast cantrip, 11 damage; dagger attack +3, 3 damage (not budgeted since there’s a more damaging at-will option).

Multi-target attacks do ½ the damage budgeted. Limited-use multi-target attacks do 2x.

This number also works for the bonus to a monster’s trained skills. Bad saving throws/untrained skills may be any value less than this. +-2 based on concept.",
