Whenever possible, a goblin must end its turn hidden; otherwise, it's vulnerable. Move/Hide/Shortbow would achieve the same offensive result but leave the goblin exposed to retaliation between turns.}. Because they attack from hiding, they roll with advantage. Regardless of whether they hit or miss, the attack gives their position away, so they change it immediately, because they can.",
								"Being a Small creature, a goblin has a good chance of Hiding successfully behind the trunk of a mature tree; even if it fails, it will still enjoy three-quarters cover (+5 AC). But since you can't hide while someone is looking directly at you, goblins have to use their movement to scramble out of the PCs' field of view, meaning they have to be close enough for their own 30-foot movement speed to describe a significant arc. At the same time, they don't want to be so close that a PC could close the gap between them and attack. So the optimal distance from the targets of their ambush is about 40 feet, no closer—and they don't want to move farther from the PCs than 80 feet, their bows' maximum range for normal shooting."

Fighting in a group, it begins on the front line with everyone else, using its Multiattack action to attack twice with its scimitar (note that the goblin boss's Multiattack has disadvantage on the second swing). As soon as it's taken even one hit, however, it changes tactics: After its Multiattack action, it Disengages (bonus action) and moves 15 feet to a position behind the front line where melee opponents can't reach it and it has \"meat cover\" against ranged attacks. On subsequent rounds, it moves up to 15 feet into a nearby hole in the front line, Multiattacks (action), Disengages (bonus action), and moves back behind the front line again. (If there's no actual hole, remember that it can move through a square occupied by an ally as if it were difficult terrain. Thus, it has just enough movement speed to go through the front line, and back, if it has to.)",

In groups consisting only of hobgoblins, they move in tight teams of four to six. If there are multiple such teams, one consists of archers, positioned between 60 and 150 feet from the action. With goblin troops, they have to be careful: Hobgoblins don't lack the courage to fight on the front line, but they know that goblins do. Rather than set an example that the goblins won't follow, they give commands from behind the front line, where they can keep an eye on the goblins and shoot at opponents with their longbows. Martial Advantage helps them in this instance, even though they're not engaged in melee themselves, as long as they're choosing targets that the goblins are engaging in melee.",
								"The more hobgoblin teams that are engaged in melee, the more sophisticated tactics they'll use. For instance, if there are three, one engages directly, one shoots from a distance, and one moves to whichever flank looks weaker before engaging. If there are four, one moves to each flank. Five or more try to encircle the PCs. These movements take place before the battle begins—hobgoblins are intelligent and disciplined enough to prepare. They also take place at a sufficient distance that their lack of Stealth won't be a hindrance.",
								"Hobgoblins don't flee when they're losing; they execute an orderly retreat. When at least two hobgoblins in a team are seriously injured (reduced to 4 hp or fewer) or killed, the team begins to fall back, starting with the most injured hobgoblins. These Disengage and retreat at their full movement speed. On the next round, the two next-most injured Disengage and also retreat at their full movement speed, while the previous two fall back only 5 feet, so as to remain in contact with the hobgoblins that are now joining them. Meanwhile, in this round, the hobgoblin archer team, if there is one, notices the retreat and focuses its arrows on any potential pursuers, in order to cover the retreat. On the third round, any hobgoblins left in the team Disengage and retreat at full movement speed, joining up with those that have already retreated. They carry out this same maneuver repeatedly, until no enemy is engaging with them anymore."

The Leadership feature is incredible: For 1 minute (that is, 10 rounds), as long as the hobgoblin captain isn't incapacitated, every allied creature within 30 feet of it gets a 1d4 buff on attack rolls and saving throws. It activates this feature just before melee combat begins, so as not to pass up its own attack action. In other respects, it fights as an ordinary hobgoblin. If there are multiple hobgoblin groups but only one hobgoblin captain, it's attached to the main melee group. Hobgoblin captains don't wield bows, but they do carry javelins.

								"Hobgoblins aren't dumb; hobgoblin warlords even less so. They know from experience that a weak opponent (one with a negative Strength modifier) usually won't withstand a Shield Bash, but a stronger opponent often will. However, they also know that if one or more of their allies can land melee attacks on a prone target before they get up—if the advantage applies to their allies' attack rolls as well, not just to the hobgoblin warlord's two attacks—then the expected value of Shield Bash is much more likely to exceed its opportunity cost. Also, in most instances, if an ally of a hobgoblin warlord is near enough to take whacks at its target, it's near enough for the warlord's Martial Advantage trait to kick in, which nearly triples the average damage of one of its Longsword attacks and roughly doubles the average total of the two together. Plus, if the ally is also a hobgoblin, its own Martial Advantage comes into play as well. Add it all together, and the Shield Bash tactic becomes effective enough to try even when it has as little as a one-in-three chance of success."

It’s indiscriminate in its target selection: It attacks whoever it can get at first. It doesn’t distinguish between targets that look weaker and targets that look stronger.

However, bugbears’ Stealth proficiency is one of their advantages, so why would they blow their cover simply to hurl taunts and threats? Bugbear chiefs have Intelligence 11 and Wisdom 12; that’s not the sort of mistake they’d make. There can’t be many circumstances in which a party of adventurers and a bugbear chief would have anything like a purposeful conversation, but I can think of a few: Maybe, somehow, the party has managed to surprise the bugbears rather than vice versa. Maybe one side is besieging the other, and they’ve reached a stalemate. Maybe the PCs are high-level enough that the bugbear chief realizes it will be hard to win a fight against them, yet they still have something the bugbears want.

Any kobold that’s the only one left fighting a single foe retreats, possibly regrouping with other kobolds fighting a different foe. However, a seriously wounded kobold (1 or 2 hp remaining) turns and runs. It’s not smart enough to Disengage to avoid an opportunity attack; it Dashes instead. If at any point the attacking kobolds no longer outnumber the front-line PCs by at least three to one, they’ll withdraw. They can’t do much damage on their own—on average, just 4 hp per hit—so they have to make every attack count.

From this point on, it’s a slugfest. As long as the orcs aren’t seriously injured, they keep fighting, using their Greataxe action every round and moving on to the next PC back if they hew down one in the front line. If there’s a PC between 30 and 60 feet past the one the orc has just felled, it has a chance to use Aggressive again—so why not?", "Despite their aggression and stupidity, even orcs know when they’re overmatched. Depending on how you, the DM, believe that this particular group of orcs should act, a seriously injured orc (reduced to 6 hp or fewer) may be willing to fight to the death for honor’s sake, or it may possess more of a will to survive, in which case it will Disengage and retreat its full movement distance. (My own inclination is to have orcs that see their fellows retreating successfully be more willing to retreat themselves, while orcs whose fellows have been slain will fight to the death themselves.) An orc that finds itself fighting two or more foes rather than just one tries to reposition itself so that it has to fight only one, if possible. Since this will always involve moving out of at least one opponent’s reach, there are three possible ways: Dodge, then reposition; Disengage, then reposition; or reposition, risking an opportunity strike, then attack. The first two, frankly, strike me as un-orc-like, while the third strikes me as very orc-like. If there’s no way for the orc to evade its extra attackers without their simply closing with it again, then Disengage/retreat seems like the most likely response—either that or, if its fellows have been slain, fiercely fighting to the death."

Orogs also have the sense to Disengage before repositioning in melee combat and may even order regular orcs to do the same.

When they spot a vulnerable target, most likely during a nighttime patrol ({@sense darkvision} provides advantage on attack rolls against PCs who don't have it), they strike at once. They're fearless and aggressive, using their full movement speed to approach their targets, then attacking with spears; if one such attack reduces an enemy to 0 hp, the gnoll Rampages toward another enemy within 15 feet and bites it (bonus action).",                     "As vicious as they are, however, gnolls are creatures of instinct without ideology, and they place their own survival over such concepts as valor or honor. If one is seriously wounded (reduced to 8 hp or fewer), it turns tail and flees, using the {@action Dash} action to get away as fast as possible and potentially exposing itself to one or more opportunity attacks in the process."

(It also wields a glaive, which I have to imagine\u2014given that even the gnoll pack lord's Intelligence is only 8\u2014consists of a pillaged sword lashed to the end of a spear. By gnoll standards, this surely qualifies as technological genius.)",                     "Incite Rampage is part of the gnoll pack lord's Multiattack combo, so the gnoll pack lord doesn't have to forgo attacking to use it. Effectively, what Incite Rampage does is grant another gnoll in the pack (a technicality in the wording of Incite Rampage restricts its application to other gnolls, plus giant hyenas, since these are the only creatures with Rampage) the equivalent of an immediate opportunity attack against its opponent. This happens during the gnoll pack lord's action. Incite Rampage consumes that gnoll's reaction, so if its opponent moves out of its reach, it can't make an actual opportunity attack.",                     "Aside from this feature, the only other distinctive thing about the gnoll pack lord is the fact that its \"glaive\" (snicker) gives it 10 feet of reach rather than 5 feet. None of this makes the gnoll pack lord's tactics any more elaborate than a regular gnoll's."

But the Fang of Yeenoghu has some actual intelligence, so it maneuvers around the battlefield and targets vulnerable PCs, particularly those who dish out a lot of damage but can't take it. Gnolls sense weakness and zero in on it, so assume that the Fang of Yeenoghu can \"read\" a PC's hit points and Armor Class and strike accordingly. This also allows the Fang of Yeenoghu to maximize the value of its Rampage feature, because by targeting PCs with fewer hit points first, it increases its chances of getting to Rampage more than once."
